# CSCI 6751 - Lecture 01: Q&A Summary

## Questions Asked During Class

### 1. Quiz Format and Notification
**Student**: Do we know before the class if we have a quiz?

**Professor**: Majorly, I shouldn't tell you directly, but sometimes I might give a hint like "you're going to have a quiz next week." It won't be announced directly - you need to be prepared for every session.

### 2. Exam Format
**Student**: Could you briefly discuss the format of the exams? Is it multiple choice?

**Professor**:
- **Midterm & Final**: Mix of multiple choice questions (MCQ) and short answer/problem-solving
- **Quizzes**: NOT multiple choice - short answer format, about 15 minutes, 1-2 questions
- **Duration**: Midterm and final are 1.5-2 hours

---

### 3. Professor's Background
**Student**: Can you speak about your own experience and professional background?

**Professor**:
- PhD in Artificial Intelligence/Engineering
- Teaching experience at multiple institutions
- Currently working in industry as well
- Tries to connect academic concepts with real-world industry applications
- Shares interview question types and industry expectations during lectures

---

### 4. Expert Systems Learning
**Student (implied)**: Do expert systems have any learning?

**Professor**: No, expert systems don't learn. They're essentially just if-then-else rules programmed by human experts. The machine doesn't learn patterns - it just matches inputs against pre-defined rules. It's not a true AI model, but rather a sophisticated program.

---

### 5. Linear Regression Applicability
**Professor (interactive question)**: Can we fit a line to predict values when the relationship is not linear?

**Class Discussion**:
- Yes, you can fit a line, but there will be errors
- The line will have some loss/error at each data point
- Goal is to minimize total error across all points
- For truly non-linear relationships, linear regression has limitations

---

### 6. Classification vs Regression
**Professor (checking understanding)**: What kind of problem is cat vs dog classification?

**Answer**: Classification - predicting discrete categories (0 or 1, or multiple classes like 1,2,3,4,5)

- Maximum absences are limited (check syllabus)
- If absent, send email to explain situation
- Participation counts toward grade

### Email Guidelines
- Keep emails short and concise (2-3 sentences)
- 40+ students means professor has limited time
- Be clear about your request

### Preparation
- Lecture notes uploaded 1-2 days in advance
- Students expected to review before class
- "Be prepared" for potential quizzes any session

## Clarifications Made

### AI vs Expert Systems
Expert systems are NOT true AI models - they're rule-based programs without learning capability. True AI involves pattern learning from data.

### Why NVIDIA is Important
- Neural networks require massive computational power
- GPUs (especially NVIDIA) are essential for training deep learning models
- NVIDIA recognized this early and became the dominant hardware provider
- This is why NVIDIA's stock has grown significantly

### Relationship: AI → ML → Deep Learning
```
AI (Artificial Intelligence)
 └── Machine Learning
      └── Deep Learning (Neural Networks)
```
Neural networks are just ONE branch of machine learning, not the whole field.

## Study Tips from Lecture

1. **Python**: Download and practice with Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
2. **Textbook**: "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" by Stuart Russell
3. **Practice**: Run the Python code examples shown in class
4. **Preparation**: Review lecture notes before each session
5. **Stay current**: Professor connects theory to real-world applications and interview questions
