[00:00:00.000] [SPEAKER_02] I'm going to share my name on the . And again, also, 
[00:00:05.059] [SPEAKER_00] we're going to discuss about the online use processing, following last session, last two sessions. We're going to discuss about some language processing, right? Which is the combination of some, I mean, let's say, large languages that we see in the . 
[00:00:30.640] [SPEAKER_02] So, the course object is, so at the end, what you want to learn, you want to understand core AI principles, and different types of machine learning, which is called supervised and unsupervised, we don't discuss about that. One of the type of supervised algorithms, neural networks, and even all of this advancement in machine learning these days, especially when they, like, the large language models, they say, is neural network. So, in other words, actually, it is also more than neural network. Okay, so first you can understand what is neural network, and after that one can understand what is the large language and the space. And also, you know, the natural language processing, its primary learning strategies, its primary learning strategies, its primary learning strategies, its primary learning strategies, its primary learning strategies, its primary learning strategies, its primary learning strategies, its primary learning strategies, its primary learning strategies, its primary strategies strategies, its primary strategies strategies! its primary strategies strategies! like, which language, I think, probably Java, or C, something like that, in the programming course, which one, I believe, like, 
[00:02:04.719] [SPEAKER_03] Java, 
[00:02:06.319] [SPEAKER_02] okay, so, if you have Java, so, you can use it, Python, it will be more easier, so, for instance, I'm already going to use it, Python, So anyway, like if you prove here you have some differences with Python. So these are some Python experiences. So I have considered that one as the reach zero. Okay, we've got some safety beforehand. We need to understand this one, but still, by next we try to review what is the format of Python code. For example, how do we define array, how do we define the kind of like pandas data structures inside of pandas, which we call data frame, okay? And what is the four node, what is the eight integration, right? How do we define the function as one of the things that we have in Python, an understanding of how we want to write the code in Python. So that's why we call it because you know as Python addresses. So this is a little bit of overview on the Python code as well, like in Python. We need to for more details work on that one on the inside. So probably you can see some here. Okay, so different 
[00:03:46.840] [SPEAKER_01] examples and 
[00:03:51.340] [SPEAKER_02] syntax you can see in Python thresholds, and you know, like this code. Or you can Google it from, you can find a free version of that one, and so on and so forth. So the main difference that people use for this code is called artificial intelligence. It's another map of it, and it's written by Russell. Okay, so Russell is the author of this code, and these are the supplements we use for this code. For neural missile, people are in parts, and the other ones, and so on and so forth. And the majority of these differences from some of the ones are in any of the free or the ones. You can look at the online. So these are not, I mean, our difference is not limited to this one. So any sort of online, or different, you can use it. Okay? We are discussing about our materials, but in reality, we don't, for example, you will get something. It's focused on videos, YouTube, different channels, and that's what we do. Okay? So, just want to mention that, our different materials is limited to this. Guys, okay. And the software we're going to use is Python, and some libraries in Python, like scikitment, Keras, typer, and OpenAI APIs for Nexelanguage Processing Parts, can be used. Any questions so far? Okay. So, there are some attendance policies, and if you, like, you know, this is important to see that if you want, you know, so we have a limitation for absence, like, in the maximum position, you have a limitation for that one. If you want, if there is something there, you can have a question, you can have a question, and I didn't come to the class, and then you can send an email to Kerasa and then, so it's not something like that. It's an adrenaline station that, oh, that was an issue that I was not able to do. So, part of our, I mean, assessment is for participation. Okay? So it's important to attend a class session, and also involve, ask a question, involving discussion, and for example. Because that's getting, you know, like, more effective way, easier for both sides, for the lecture and for you guys, right? So, that's why participation and involvement is important. If you take classes, it's going to be 2 % of the lecture. Okay? And we've got some assignments, or weekly assignments, some of them in class, some of them in the ultimate. And that's the 10%. Uh, meetup is 50%, and final project and presentation, it's going to be working together in a group of 2 -3 people. Okay? 203, not 203, not 203, but then we're going to be working together in a group of 2 -3 people. So, I will talk about that one in detail, when the time comes. And, uh, what you need for that one, we do the response. Okay? Uh, any questions so far? Okay, so these are the, uh, classroom, uh, I mean, rules, uh, like, arrive on time, be prepared, where you say be prepared means that I do not close the, uh, lecture notes, in, uh, in advance. So you're going to have access to that for at least one, two days, uh, in advance, I will upload the lecture notes. So, you need to prepare yourself for the class and be, uh, ready. Right? And, uh, also, like, if you want to send email, just make it concise. I'm writing to say that, just, two, three sentences. Right? Just short and concise. Okay? Because the reason is that, like, you know, around 40 students, you know, and I'll request for this student. And if it's a long email, I will not have enough time to read it. But it's the short and concise, okay, I got it. I can't do that. Okay? So that's important to be clear about your email, uh, uh, okay? I'm also concerned. Okay? So we know that functionality is very important and, you know, uh, uh, if you need any assistance, just send me email in a, like, in a, like, don't post on it later. So if you have any, any sort of help, just let me know. Uh, I think the, the, the rest is about the course schedule. So what we, I, I, I have here, today is January 15th, I believe that, So this is for today. It's actually, January 20th. This is for machine learning and phone. Everything is clear here. So the midterm exam is going to be 24 of the 15th. Okay? So for now, let's consider this one. It's going to be your midterm. Okay? And the final exam, so final exam is 8 .3. So, same time, I believe that this one becomes the same. For this one, you need to check the schedule. Majorly, that's the same by my class. And then, if it's not a 6 .15, majorly, you're, I know it's done. Maybe save something like that. At least same day, right? So, with that one, check your exam 5 table. I'm not sure it's prepared here. It's uploaded or not. But, an appropriate contact one. So, and remember, this is a great thing. So, as you might see here, we have some quizzes. And what is a quiz? It means it's not going to be completed. Okay? So you're going to have two quizzes. One before exam, and one after exam. So, and that's something that, usually, it's, it's, it's not fitted. So you need to put it up. Okay. You're going to have to, who knows? No one. Okay? So, you need that, that's what you need to be ready for. For, every session. Okay? Make sense? 
[00:11:44.340] [SPEAKER_03] Uh, Professor, do 
[00:11:45.799] [SPEAKER_02] we know, before the class, we have a quiz? Do we, do you tell us, before the class? majorly, what, what's happening is that quiz means that, I, I shouldn't be told you that, like, but, let's see, like, sometimes I say, okay, you're going to have, increase next week, 
[00:12:06.240] [SPEAKER_00] but 
[00:12:06.860] [SPEAKER_02] it's a hint, right? 
[00:12:08.080] [SPEAKER_00] Okay. 
[00:12:08.980] [SPEAKER_02] So, then you're going to get there. Yeah. Like, then the quiz time comes, like, majorly, say that, okay, next week, or maybe next week, you're going to have a quiz. Okay? So, like that. Yeah, maybe in advance, I, I don't let you know, but it's not directly. Okay? Okay. Thank you. Yeah. No problem. For, the date, everything is, Okay. I think all these are related to, you have information. If you, if you need me for any accommodation, and just let me know, like, if there are some information here. Okay? So, you can call me, or just email me, and explain your situation. And also, the importance of, is about, academic, integrating, right, uh, right, so this is hard. It's not covering the world. And, uh, yeah, I think that's it. Any questions? Could you briefly discuss the format of the, the format of the, is it multiple choice, when you're like, Yeah. Okay. Good question. So, the question here is, the format of the, the, let's say that, we don't have, we have enough, for that time, but in general, so, for example, for the mean term, we have some, local choice, questions, and people, and also, some, some, some, some, some, some, but in quizzes, majorly, it's not the, MCQ. The final and midterm, we have MCQ, but 
[00:14:02.419] [SPEAKER_00] in quizzes, it's not MCQ, it's a final, it's a final, it's a final, and the quizzes, is not something like, the long exam, it's gonna be for 15 minutes, maybe one, two questions, but in the midterm and five, right now, we're gonna have, one or a half, 
[00:14:23.080] [SPEAKER_02] two hours, okay, okay, question? Any other questions? Can you, we'd really, speak about your own experience, and your experience, and your professional, what is your main area, but, you know, I mean, about you personally, what is your experience? Okay, okay, okay, So, okay, so, I'll, I think you're asking about, my experience, so, um, my PhD is in, artificial engineering, right, and, uh, I have been teaching, all the, all the training, right, in the, here, um, here also, and, I don't have to, here, and at the same time, I'm really, in the last year, so, one of the, important things, that's majorly, I try to convey, in the class, is that, for example, for the philosophy, and academia, right, because, addressing, in both directions, is possible, right, so, for example, when I'm talking about, the, I say that this is an important part, in philosophy, right, like, uh, for interviews, right, I, I, I, that means, this type of question, right, with some, my own experience, right, so, yeah, like, depends 
[00:15:58.879] [SPEAKER_00] on how much, you're asking questions, right, so, I'm, I'm greatly, talking here, but, if you ask, if you have more interest, it can, you know, and, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, okay, 
[00:16:19.159] [SPEAKER_02] so, I think that's all, I think that's all, uh, any other questions, or needs gratification? Okay, so, let's start, so, the question is that, what is the API, right, so, the question is that, we know that, AI is a, is our computer, so, we know that, computer science, and we're going to get, uh, these, let's say sets, and AI is just one subset, like that, okay, and, we are focusing on, creating the machines, which are intelligent, okay, then we say intelligent, then, that means that they are able to do, some tasks, like, which, similar to, uh, like a, human, okay, but in artificial intelligence, so, what type of, uh, an artificial intelligence, agent can do, is, building, practicing his learning, and we say, learning is that, like, suppose that you're coming to the class, right, and at first, you don't have any knowledge about something, like, like, that's a great one, okay, so, great one, maybe there's no knowledge, right, so what's happening, some lessons, uh, you are taking some courses, right, and, uh, you're going to get some knowledge, okay, and then, uh, based on those knowledge, what you can do, you can reason, later, okay, so you are trained for something first, which is called learning, and then, you can reason, and then, you can reason, if I ask something, which is out of that context, you can reason, say, okay, because of this reason, right, the answer for this question, is going to be, this, machine AI machine is able to, uh, uh, to do this sort of task, so, for saying, is learning, is getting enough knowledge, and finding some, let's say, an internal inside of the data, and then, if we have an unseen data, which is not seen in our knowledge base, okay, it's still, that agent can, reason, and answer, okay, so, learning, reason, so, that's the two things that we have, most of the, uh, almost all of the AI agents, or AI machines, are, uh, are, uh, uh, problem solving, okay, and conflict problems, because it's a problem, which, human can't do that, right, so, or, the human can do, but, uh, it takes time, we use, AI agent, there, so, some of the AI agents, uh, have some sensors, okay, like robots, okay, or, we call that one as, or, for example, suppose that, autonomous driver, right, so, autonomous driver has some, cameras, detect objects, each time, says the objects, says the environment, uh, actually, detect objects, and based on those objects, you know, like, uh, in the past, some, different actions, right, from the, uh, let's say the, cornering, I don't know, acceleration, or, let's say the, breaking the system, so, AI, have, and, uh, and, uh, sensing data, and, some of the AI machines, not all of them, can understand language, and, uh, how they make a, make a decision. Making procedures, and, making procedures, learning and, and what the problem solving, are, something that, the older AI agency has, some of those are, specific for MLP, national language, language processing, right, so that means that, probably, some of the, you know, AI agency, don't have the language on this side. Okay? But, other parts, this one, this one, this one, and this one, is something that, the old AI agency has. Any questions? Okay. So, we know that, AI has, uh, different context. Right? In art, you can create, you can create, you can create, artistic, I don't know, Okay? As, I don't know, like, this image, that, uh, with this, or, like, artistic, uh, capabilities, and economic, you can use, such as, to be, friendly, economy, 
[00:22:08.859] [SPEAKER_01] right? Like, what you can do, for, for, 
[00:22:11.759] [SPEAKER_00] for, science, science, psychology, philosophy, and so on. So, we want to say that, all of them has, its own application, uh, like, called AI. 
[00:22:28.599] [SPEAKER_02] I, so, this important thing, that, first I want to discuss, so, I mentioned that, like, AI agent, is something that, can learn, as a reason. Right? This is one definition. The formal definition for AI agent, is, uh, coming from, 3S. What is 3S? It's an S, that's, done by, Alan Train, this guy, this is part of, let's say, computer science, and, uh, as we might, in, uh, in that time. And what does this, uh, say? It says, that suppose that we have a, wall here. Right? We have a wall. On one side, we have a, human. Okay? This slide. On the other side, we have two signals. We have one human, and we have one agent. Okay? AI agent. You want to see that? Okay. So, in this test, what we are doing, uh, this human, human agent, is communicate with, these guys on the other side. If, if this human, don't have, don't understand, the answer comes from the AI, or human, that means that, that train does this pass. So, what I mean is that, suppose we don't have this one. We have just this one. So, they are talking to the, okay, asking something, this one, giving the answer, right? Just saying, just chat, doing this for me. Okay? And, if, meanwhile, this human, don't understand, the answer comes from, human, or agent, that means that, that agent, can tell the agent. that makes sense? So, yeah, so, if the human cannot, reliably tell the difference between the human, and the machine, then the machine is said to have, and that machine is, a AI. 
[00:25:01.200] [SPEAKER_01] Okay? 
[00:25:01.839] [SPEAKER_02] This is the sum of the, okay, so, this definition is, done in, in, in 1950. Okay? So, we want to show the history of AI here. Right? Right now we are here, 2020, 2006, right? So, and what's happened, like, for the first time, we can say that this silence, we can say that this silence, of the AI, is that it's kind of like young, it's not like very old science. And, it started in 1950, almost 25, sorry, 75 years ago. Okay? So, the first thing is done, the first concept, was two eighties, in 1950. Okay? And then after that one, like, in 1956, we had a conference, first conference, or workshop, for AI, and that's called darkness. And, in that conference, or workshop, for the first time, concept of AI, was needed. Okay? So, here, it was some, just, experiment, right? But, here, they came together, and for the first time, talked about, or this was about, one in the AI. Okay? 
[00:26:39.339] [SPEAKER_01] And then, in 1980s, like, we have, I'm going to discuss about that one. 
[00:26:47.119] [SPEAKER_02] After 1980s, that's the era, that's the time that, 
[00:26:50.960] [SPEAKER_01] neural networks, appeared. 
[00:26:54.059] [SPEAKER_02] Okay? Neural networks, invented. Okay? So, for example, in 2012, the deep learning is introduced. And, deep learning was very, like, changed it, I mean, AI, dramatically. Okay? So, and after that one, we had different type of deep learning algorithms. For example, in 2020, we had TPT3, then we had TPT4, and we had TPT4, and we had TPT2 in 2023, and it was two years ago, to remember. And nowadays, we have HNVAR. Okay? So, this is a cat. Any questions in this cat? I'm going to go with the details of this. Okay? So, I'm going to go with the details of this. So, over these 75 years, there have been some, you know, ups and downs. Here. So, ups and downs, for example, uh, it's going to be, something like this. 1950, we started, and then, we had a boom here. Okay? Then, X, uh, went down. So, for some time, the AI concept was, you know, we're not that much important. Okay? Again, you know, another, let's say, period started. Second AI boom. And that's the time that, we had the, you know, here, we had the, uh, let's say, neural network. And, 1990s, machine learning concept, this part of the group. So, we had some, three, let's say, room here, um, first, second, and third AI boom. And then, still, it's going up, right? It's going up, uh, I think these days, like, kind of like, more slow. Uh, because of those, uh, large language models. Okay? Which is cost. Okay, so as you see, like, dark moves, I'm talking about this one, dark conference. 
[00:29:28.640] [SPEAKER_00] In 1956, that was, I got a first workshop on AI. 
[00:29:34.059] [SPEAKER_02] And that's the, uh, kind of like, course of AI, as the academy. Okay? As the academy. Okay, as the academy. so, we have expert systems, right? That is in 1980s, in the June, in 1980s, almost in 1980s, right? 1980 -ish, I think, 1980s, I think, the, also we had, some code here. Like, part of this one was related to normal network, part of that one is, resulting in expert systems. So, let's say, what is the expert system? So, expert system, uh, for me, one of the most, example, is my scene. Uh, something like this. It has an object like that. And what, what does this architecture say? It is that, like, we don't have any learning here. So, but, what we do, we are asking an expert, for sure. We are talking, first we talk to the expert person. Let's say, in economy. Okay? We want to know that, what can happen for this task? Okay? We go and take one expert guy, and talk to this. And, that expert person, needs also some facts, some rules. And, okay, for example, if the situation, or economic situation, is like this, you need to get this task. Okay? Just like this, get the other one. Okay? All of these rules, all of these rules, all of these rules, comes from a sphere, which is human expert. This one is human expert. So, based on, this human expert, first we created knowledge base. And, what is the knowledge base? It's some facts, and rules. Okay? And, what's happening, so, this machine, has some sensors. Okay? Take some information, let's say the user interface, or using some, interfaces, right? And, and, and, and, post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post take the input, pass it to knowledge base and see which one of those rules is going to be treated and based on one or two or 
[00:32:35.500] [SPEAKER_01] more of those rules, 
[00:32:39.099] [SPEAKER_02] some actions are going to be done So what is important here, we have our input, we have an inference engine and inference engine uses their knowledge base Ok, so, for example, I want to make another example, like the YC What is the YC? YC was some sort of like, let's say in that area, that was kind of like an express system for maybe some of the YC, ok, but what we had, we already talked to one doctor, and doctors said that, ok, if you have, for example, these symptoms, you need to take this, I don't know, this tablet, ok, and all those are the same information on the other side Right now, a cursor refers to this machine and says, ok, I have these symptoms, what's going to happen? It was there, it turned the symptoms, and then inference engine, based on those inputs, check and see that which one of these rules is going to be treated and try to give some specific, and try to give some specific, ok, make sense? So, probably you see that one is the explanation system here, and knowledge acquisition system, so explanation system is some module that explains that, why I am giving this its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its' its ok so we have this module X here and this one is just for acquisition of the so this our picture is called X -perge system do we have any learning here? do we have any learning? no yeah what we have we qualify this but the machine doesn't learn 
[00:35:42.539] [SPEAKER_01] those it doesn't learn, just database yeah 
[00:35:44.699] [SPEAKER_02] we are just adding some rules here so this one is not kind of like AI model we want to look at it's not AI model it's a kind of like program simple program simple if then else all together this is nothing more than some if then else right there isn't any learning from the pattern so it's not something like this it takes some data and then check this data and see what's happening all those rules for pattern are provided already by X -perge system X -perge person that's why there isn't any pattern that's covered in that the only thing is just checking condition of those rules will cover in both right that's why it's nothing more than a simple program but in that time that wasn't wild right so okay that was 1985 that's why okay but 
[00:37:01.980] [SPEAKER_00] here we see that it was I don't know this 
[00:37:05.099] [SPEAKER_02] example let's say why didn't in that time this X -perge system was very important because that was the first real time like real world example of these sort of machines before that one so in Dartmouth just this but in this time the creating machine right now we know that's not like a very smart but in that time that was the first real world application that's why you know we see that there is too much it's not probably that in some systems X -perge system is used right for example customer support it's it could be very useful right so if the customer asks some questions like this or Matt answer this right so we ask okay I'm a customer I refer to the machine and tell us that okay I want this one this one and 
[00:38:23.239] [SPEAKER_01] then that machine tells you okay based on what you include to me the answer is going to be 
[00:38:30.820] [SPEAKER_02] just matching with something okay so that's why you see that customer support is possible engineer financial again like in finance that economy some rules can be okay so okay so okay okay I also like to be having this area I mean in this era in this time we have another thing which is called phosilogic okay 
[00:39:09.239] [SPEAKER_01] still phosilogic is viewed in these states as well 
[00:39:14.260] [SPEAKER_02] okay I want to explain phosilogic in high level so because it means a separate course for this but 
[00:39:32.199] [SPEAKER_01] that's like this 
[00:39:35.320] [SPEAKER_02] suppose a current means the temperature here is 25 okay so we check the temperature and see if that's 25 I ask you is it warm someone say yes it's warm the other one is saying that okay it's not too much warm to me right so the other one is saying like to me over 30 is regarded as you know warm right or 
[00:40:07.559] [SPEAKER_00] maybe 
[00:40:08.000] [SPEAKER_02] for example if I say that like zero is cold no okay maybe someone says zero is freezing right it means not tolerated there's some concept for which the answer is not crazy it's not yes and no okay so what does it mean that means that it's a positive okay is it a chair or warm is it positive right so we have something like this suppose this one is temperature okay five and fifteen twenty okay twenty twenty twenty thirty thirty thirty thirty -five and so on and so forth okay and here we have here only that one i will take one okay so here in twenty -one it's one and i have it like a three and i have it like a something like this okay and we call that one as one what does it mean that means that twenty -five is one but it's still twenty twenty and we consider as one but it's membership degree is not one it's something like from zero point eight okay for ten it's zero point five for zero it's zero okay so! ! if somebody asks you is it the twenty war you don't say 
[00:42:49.420] [SPEAKER_00] yes or 
[00:42:50.139] [SPEAKER_02] no you say twenty it's a war with the membership or degree of zero point eight okay? this is called the concept of quasi logic so which try to extend classical logic of true -false to 
[00:43:14.539] [SPEAKER_01] some degree of truth 
[00:43:17.000] [SPEAKER_02] okay? and it is useful let me want to reason under unsentity okay so if you checking google for 
[00:43:35.639] [SPEAKER_01] you you can see that item one you want to google it 
[00:43:50.199] [SPEAKER_02] okay i think rice maker probably it okay i think rice maker its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its It was post -logic was post -logic was post -logic was post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post

[00:44:49.059] [SPEAKER_02] post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post post I want to mention that this is not just a theoretical concept and it is kind of like a stress system so the rules are in the format of T10 and it says that for example if the temperature is high then the speed is high or if the temperature is high, I don't know but it can increase the fan speed you want to create a controller and in that controller it wants to check if the temperature is high or not ok, so is it 25? I need to increase the fan speed how about 24? yes, so 24 is going to increase the fan speed because it is still 24 is 1 but not with the degree of 1 it is 0 .1 ok, so the fan speed is also going to be increased but not with the degree of 1 it is going to be proportional to the temperature so again you see this guy our different concept for cool for warm for hot for hot and also for freezing because after a while freezing is getting like this the temperature is getting higher freezing is getting smooth so consider quasi -logic like this is used in experts ok, and in our rules all rules all rules are not just yes and no in our rules what we have we have the concept of quasi -logic it is not like increase 2 and 1 we have degree of 2 and then ABS brakes, right? you are driving ABS brakes I am not sure what kind of brakes right now is used but in English phrase this is technology of uh positive ok ok ok so so so so so far it was you know always the the the the the the the the the the the the the its its its its 
[00:48:40.300] [SPEAKER_01] its its 
[00:48:43.659] [SPEAKER_02] its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its Everyone has millions of neurons, right? And these neurons are connected to each other. And they are doing message passing to each other to do some tasks. Okay? Suppose each of these has one neuron in your brain. Okay? They are connected to each other, right? And in different layers, we have different neurons. Okay? And what we want to do, we are 
[00:49:28.559] [SPEAKER_00] sensing something. Okay? 
[00:49:31.920] [SPEAKER_02] For example, I have this device. Okay, this device. I'm getting this device. And, okay, what's happening? Feel that this one has their, I don't know, 180 degrees. I'm getting this device. I open it, and then, you know, I touch the water. And then, I do some actions, right? I do this part. I'm getting a, I don't know, I get, uh, I'm gonna show some actions. Right? What's happening here? There's some neurons. For example, I sense this baby here. Water, right? So, I sense, I'm passing towards some neurons in my mind, like quickly. Okay? And then, it generates output. What is the output? The output is that I just let the click, what's the top? Okay? So, what I want to mention is that, like, what we have in our brain, we can stimulate similar mechanisms in the format of neural network. So, neural network is something we call, that when it's artificial neural network. It's the same as what we see in our brain. Okay? They are doing the same thing. Some calculations, right? So, we can see that some neurons are connected to each other to do one specific task. Okay? I will, I will talk about this one in more detail. But what is important, you see that all 
[00:51:22.619] [SPEAKER_00] the 
[00:51:22.780] [SPEAKER_01] neurons 
[00:51:23.239] [SPEAKER_02] of the previous layer are connected, kind of like fully connected to that, right? Every node is connected to other nodes. And then, every node here are connected to other nodes here. And so on and so forth. We call that one as fully connected neural network or dense neural network because it's a kind of dense track. True? Okay? So, how do we use that one? I am going to discuss about that. We need that. Okay? Maybe we use this one. Why do we need this one? What does this one want to say? Okay? I understand. In my mind, in my brain, yes, there are more things that we can do. We have lots of neurons, but what's the relationship between this and machine networks? Are they connected to each other? Okay? So, so, uh, okay. Some of the neural networks are deep neural networks. In design, it doesn't have just three hidden layers, right? We call this one hidden layers. This one input layer, this one output layer. This one output layer. This one output layer. If we input that output layer, whatever you see, it's called hidden layers. Sometimes hidden layers is not three layers. We have probably millions of layers. Or millions of layers. Sometimes maybe we have thousands of layers, right? Thousand layers in each layer we have too much. So, okay? So, to process a neural network like this, we need a strong computer. So, that's why majorly neural networks are run on GPUs. Okay? So, not on neural machines. Okay? Like this one, this one. You can run, but for complicated, no more networking, you want that one in GPUs. That's why, like, you see that these days, NVIDIA, right? Have you heard about NVIDIA? So, NVIDIA is a hardware company. I think, like, ten years ago, someone say NVIDIA, what's that? What's that company? Okay? Nobody knows about that. In that time, Intel, AMD, was there for the famous companies. Okay? But, when they, like, deep learning concepts, neural networks, neural networks, were invented, the first thing NVIDIA company discovered, or understood, is that we need a strong machine. Okay? So, let's, let's make this, like, a great GPUs. Okay? So, what you see these days about NVIDIA and make it famous is because of the GPUs. Okay? They're just generating NVIDIA. They're amazing. Other companies, like Intel, AMD, they're making it a simple, right? If you don't, it's going to be AMD or Intel, right? But, there was a very strong job for NVIDIA. And that was because of the invention of the neural network. That's the same thing. They're saying, how many, these days, the first company in the world? Well, the first company in terms of the, you know, stock is going to be in the world. 
[00:55:09.239] [SPEAKER_00] Right? Okay. 
[00:55:17.179] [SPEAKER_02] Okay. So, what is the answer for lower PyTorch? I think we'll give up PyTorch. So, PyTorch is a library. I think it's a library in my turn. Hold me for running the run. Okay? So, if you use the hardware, these are the software that you use for. Okay? So, you see that, like the red line shows that AR. And machine learning is a problem for more than they have a total of 1 feet. I mean, acreage, right? So, 
[00:56:43.619] [SPEAKER_00] that's why after a while, like these two are getting the same thing. 
[00:56:49.099] [SPEAKER_02] So, the machine learning is getting the same thing. Yeah. We're shifting to machine learning. 1991. Right here. See? My fear is the rise of machine learning. Shifting to machine learning. Okay. Okay. So, what is the machine learning? So, in high level, machine learning means that we have some data. We take those data and try to find a pattern inside of that data. Okay? Some of the data are labeled. Some of those are not labeled. When you say labeled, means that, for example, suppose that, suppose what? Suppose you are referring to a bank, and based on your profile, bank, predict that you are risky or not. Okay? You are a risky customer or not. How do banks know? Banks have a prediction model, which will really train, same based on what? Same based on what? What's the data? Okay? Ali is a risky customer. Based on his profile. Okay? You are not risky customer. Based on your profile. Right? And so on and so forth. The data set. Okay? And for each profile, we have one column. It is risky, it is risky 1. If not, it is 0. Okay? So. And then, we take this data, and look at the data, and understand that. For example, the age of customer is younger, and customer, I don't know, are living in this area. Okay? So mostly, the customer is 60, or age of, right? So look at the data, and try to find some access. Okay? This is called training. Maybe I, as a human, can do that one. But suppose that we have millions of data. So, you need a machine, you need an algorithm, it checks all of these data, and find the patterns. Try to classify. Okay? So, the age is between this, and this education is this, either who is this, it's gonna be risky. Of course, it's not being risky, right? Okay. So, here, our training data, is a labor data. What do we call labor? Is this for each customer? Like, previous customers, we know that it's risky or not. 
[01:00:08.000] [SPEAKER_00] Right? 
[01:00:09.679] [SPEAKER_02] So, we train a model, in other words, we look at those data, and understand what kind of profiles are going to be, is, now, I refer to the bank, as an unseen customer, a new customer. And it doesn't matter, I don't know that, I'm risky or not. Just take my profile, pass it to model, and the model, which has already trained, tells that, he or she is, as risky or not. Okay? So, what we have, we have two things. Training, and then prediction. Okay? So, training, finding patterns inside of the data, and then, prediction. Okay? So, prediction means that, critical unseen data according to the unit right so if our data is labeled that's why our learning is called supervised supervised supervised means that our data or training is labeled because we have we have group 1 and 0 ok if it's not it's called supervised ok so for example emails we have millions of emails some of those are not now you get a new email how to classify that one as or not as ok how to understand that there's a trained model in background ok already right what was done that 
[01:02:17.539] [SPEAKER_00] trained model has taken millions of data 
[01:02:21.039] [SPEAKER_02] ok millions of emails and know that this one was ok because it has 
[01:02:29.659] [SPEAKER_00] some some advertisement information or some words right some specific words 
[01:02:38.840] [SPEAKER_02] ok so trained understand understand now if you get a new email just pass it to trained model and say that ok this is your company ok because it's trained the pattern of spam emails is going to be like this understand ok or another like like you want to create a model which predicts the price of houses in downtown Vancouver ok you don't need a real flow you want to have a AI region which tells what's the price of I don't know or that condo ok in intersection like in this trust ok so how do you know that we have a suppose we have thousands of properties for each property we have the price of that the 
[01:03:52.719] [SPEAKER_00] current trust 
[01:03:53.360] [SPEAKER_02] then we train a model that model helps takes those information ok I have this property it has three houses two bathrooms I don't know this level this level this area is this much ok close to downtown or not and so on and so forth and the price is like this we have thousands of thousands of those labels the data ok what do we know this price ok now I want to know what is the what could be the price of another apartment which I don't know the price of that ok so we train the model now I give information of that apartment to our model because our model understood that pattern inside of that model if it's like a two bedroom close to downtown close to downtown and for example first alone its price is going to be this ok so check that which one is matching which of this pattern and then provide you to sort of like prediction ok so we have training and then always prediction to training or train our model we need to have like a train oh sorry label label label ok 
[01:05:32.159] [SPEAKER_01] ok 
[01:05:35.079] [SPEAKER_02] so that's why we want to create some data the real new models why we call data the real one because it's working based on data it's not based on some x there's no x there's no x it is like x means that rather than data we have a real this field code comes through the rules it's going to be something like x right but here we have what's some data and then we train that one using two -month learning basically example we train and then we train ok so this term is one example another example is the switch like what we see in the city alexov right so alexov understand alexov what's the temperature right now already train already train already train and then or you ask alexov what's the capital city of Canada 
[01:06:48.119] [SPEAKER_00] ok 
[01:06:49.619] [SPEAKER_02] maybe maybe there are some train and then alexov can predict i think this example is not clear now it's a fact but sometimes like you ask ok what would be the alexov what would be the temperature two -month this kind of prediction how it understands because it knows that like basically historically the past years in January the weather in Vancouver was like this ok and then probably take some average of and give you some even if we can create precise models that actually may tell you that's what's ok so i want to make this one just mention that in this time we have the wishing learning right i learned for wishing learning that then since 2000 2000 our data is getting bigger and bigger right for example like you know like in banking system probably have millions of transactions in the right or for example like suppose Amazon or any online shopping there like millions of customers they came to that portal and tried to do some shopping right or tried to click this one then click this one all of this information are big data right so they processing is different normal data so if you want to create machine learning for those big data is kind of like different from 
[01:09:06.100] [SPEAKER_01] regular data that's why I 
[01:09:08.800] [SPEAKER_02] mean getting computers are getting bigger so also our data is getting bigger so at least we know that's like it's kind of like easy so we see the clouds like AWS from Amazon Google different data stories are just scoring the big data okay so in relation of big data is that our AI should match itself with big data and have sense so that's what we see that 2001 war we made an inventor and then accordingly the machine learning on world you should update and so with that change okay so this is almost same thing that we have but just for normal anymore so in this picture i want to emphasize some of these guys which are very famous guys and you need to know their names remember their names right so one of those is these guys these guys are their like fathers right and but in this picture you see this guy who is this guy? who is this guy? jepri hinton jepri hinton okay jepri hinton is a kind of professor in torrento university okay and that's this guy right? yeah he has got the noble prize 20 -20 or he played noble prize in physics and he asked why he did okay 
[01:11:17.420] [SPEAKER_01] because technically they kind of like moral network are related to physics as well okay so 
[01:11:32.199] [SPEAKER_02] okay so so this guy is important guy the other one is lecon this one okay so this guy is so these guys are depending on and lecon you can see that okay yeah the lecon is yeah it's new okay yeah the lecon is yeah it's new okay so one of the same flies in okay so i 
[01:12:18.979] [SPEAKER_00] should say that these two percent the lecon and the lecon 
[01:12:27.119] [SPEAKER_02] also like you see that here okay so you see that lecon introduced cn convolutional okay some part of advancement of and 
[01:12:46.399] [SPEAKER_01] here in the new 
[01:12:47.439] [SPEAKER_00] generation these 
[01:12:48.520] [SPEAKER_02] are gpt and deep -secant and so and all of them are based on global network and based on transport this so transformers are based on neural network and activities based on transport so neural network network is a core of all of them okay so again to show the importance of AI these days i want to emphasize that again in 2024 novel price in chemistry is also given to AI three s from computer science department okay why because they have to do with the transformers neural networks to what 
[01:14:08.699] [SPEAKER_03] design a 
[01:14:10.260] [SPEAKER_02] new project drug discovery okay we use the national drug discovery okay so what we need is writing biological the company alcohol so the work is accurate treating protein structure taking protein structure right using deep -lip the technology and physical AI that's why that's why that's why AI active forefront 
[01:15:02.979] [SPEAKER_01] any questions any 
[01:15:20.100] [SPEAKER_02] questions of machine learning and we know what it stands for 
[01:15:32.460] [SPEAKER_01] D -flat 
[01:15:33.720] [SPEAKER_02] okay so what do we suppose suppose it is set it is called what we have here we have here for example expert systems we have here we have here we have probes okay all of them are under the umbrella of AI 
[01:16:25.079] [SPEAKER_01] right so ML machine learning is a part of AI and deep remain which is part of 
[01:16:39.340] [SPEAKER_02] machine learning okay so it shows that we have machine learning algorithms and neural networks are only part of this neural network is not everything to machine learning it's just some branch of machine learning okay so we want to see that like for example design keep learning maybe we have decision trees we have sbn we have decision trees 
[01:17:20.720] [SPEAKER_01] and so on and so forth okay but this one is let's make it more 
[01:17:27.859] [SPEAKER_02] and focus it's a modern type of machine learning okay so some examples 
[01:17:41.659] [SPEAKER_01] for 
[01:17:43.439] [SPEAKER_02] deep learning okay face circumcision use your alcohol and then detect your face for example and then you what happens is a train model okay 
[01:18:00.960] [SPEAKER_01] based on the 
[01:18:04.520] [SPEAKER_02] okay self -driving car you're driving suppose that i think in Canada it's not allowed yet but in the US you see that these days there are some motorbike right so you go Uber and Uber have you taken the autonomous car so far is there anyone that experience okay so right here it's gonna be based on deep learning okay so automatically detect the object okay oh there is a car over there there is an industry and it's passing how wonder is that 
[01:18:46.079] [SPEAKER_00] how 
[01:18:47.520] [SPEAKER_02] how is that its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its its 
[01:19:03.260] [SPEAKER_00] its its its its its its 
[01:19:05.960] [SPEAKER_02] its its its its its its its its its its its the model and that model tells that once and not. Because that model already changed and among 
[01:19:28.840] [SPEAKER_00] millions of others. 
[01:19:30.520] [SPEAKER_02] Okay, so self -driving cars. Okay, so robots. Generative AI to create images. As chat CPT generates this image for me. Okay, so all of them based on the model. Also generated AI for language. Okay, so you're asking a question and the answer for when you are doing the chat with machine. Okay. Okay, so I think these are the let's say the high level examples. Like the field examples that we have. But in general I want to see that what movie -ary machine is. So this is up here. I think there are some examples that we can get and talk about this slide. These are just introduction. So yeah. Uh up here uh this can take a break for three minutes. Okay. We've got to
