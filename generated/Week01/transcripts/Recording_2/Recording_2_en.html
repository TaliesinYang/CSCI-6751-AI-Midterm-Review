So, as I mentioned, we have AI, machine learning is just a triangle of that one, and we're turning this triangle machine. So, this is the same thing. Okay, here's an example, natural language processing, planning. Okay, so, this one is crossing, crossing means that we take some data, and try to partition it. Okay? In clustering, our data is not data. So, all of them, suppose that in a node, there is a lot of them are black. Okay? But, crossing takes the whole, and try to group them. And after that, we'll need to group as a non -compa. Okay? So, just grouping based on their similarity of closeness. It's called sometimes partition. Okay, what is the regression? Suppose this one is age, and this one is riskiness between zero to one unit. Okay? So, for example, I have a customer here. Okay? This one is riskiness. Okay? Or score. Or whatever. And then I have another customer here. Ages here. Okay? Or maybe you can consider something like this. Age. And let's say the, rather than riskiness, we can say approval. Okay? Age approval. So, younger is the chance of approval is less. Right? So, what we want to do, we want to see that what is the pattern we cite in this point. Right? So, I see that, like, there's increasing pattern here. Increasing age leads to like view of the increase of like view of epsilon here. Right? So, what I see here, is that, okay, can I see a line like this one to predict the amount of that two up here? Can I do that? Good question. The linear line, I mean linear function is okay here? Yes? Yes or no? Yes? So, who says yes? Now is enough. Who says no? Who says yes? Who says no? Who says no? Just raise your hand for yes. Okay. means that you say no? Okay. Okay, so what we have here is that yes, we can keep a line but there's going to be some error here. Okay, for example if I have a data like this and I want to keep a line, so in some of the points there's not a error. If I go and cross it's going to be here. There's no error, but what is here? So it should be I pull out like the model is here but my ground choice is here. Right? There is this much error. Okay? Or for example, I take this point and if I want to see what it's happening on this model or the line right? Right? Here but the actual value or ground choice is here so yes, you can pick a line but consider that that line should be should have some errors right? Some losses right? Some errors because we see that relationship is not linear so relationship is something like non -linear right? There is no linearity right? so that's why in one line probably can't do that okay? But so we call this one linear regression linear regression is that take some input and for each input we have one and for each x we have one y then two people line which that line is representative of all y's okay? we say yes but it's going to be sound yes okay? all the points was like in I mean in one line we could keep an idea of that right? the line make a minimum error okay? </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_368000_371000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:06:08.379]</span> SPEAKER_02: so </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_371000_747000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:06:11.420]</span> SPEAKER_01: okay so we have supervised unsupervised entry for some learning this one is supervised and I think like means that we have some data okay? unsupervised means we have like just playing with update and after you know there are some objects here this infant try to group them based on their size okay? based on their size or based on their color try to group them okay? so suppose based on their size grouping them right? so here data is not labeled the obviously is just out here and their size color so that's called one super ones okay? in other words we have some points we try to group the points just not based on the color because we don't suppose we don't have tools here also we don't have any color for this option but their size are different okay? so here we have similar things like there are some points all of them have black color but some of those are close to each other so we group them together and we call each other one plus here so for personal learning this means that like a trainer you start from I mean for uh path finding right? so we start from uh this point and try to go to destination right? maybe some training error like a real personal learning okay so suppose that we want to create a model we want to create a model first we need to understand what is our goal okay so our goal is that taking some image and based on each image of you are driving right so you take an image right let's say take a picture and see what's that picture is it a car is it police or whatever right is it crossroad or whatever okay so first of all we need to know that what is our goal of that program and then based on that goal we gather our training data okay we use of the images and then based on that train the data train the model okay train the model based on data to let's say so let's say what is our training data gather those training data and create a model and then try to predict predict on testing data on testing data okay and accuracy of the model is important because if the model is not accurate the prediction of the model is going to be with some errors okay so that's everything like you to consider when you want to define the model so what's all the goal based on that goal gather the information gather the data training data using training data create our model and then try to predict so of course accuracy of the model is important so when you say define the model okay like define a problem the problem here is cat or dog so we need different images of cat and dog right probably this one is cat this one is also cat right so also you see that there's kind of rotation this one is also cat okay but these guys are dog right so maybe if you have enough data and for each data for each image you need to have one column tells that it is cat or dog right so what kind of problem is that is it classification or regression we want to classify right in two groups it's a kind of integer right 0 and sometimes maybe it's not 0 and 1 we have five classes 0, 1 or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 right like five and one so that's the classification so this is one of the most difficult part and expensive part for us to have like clean data okay because sometimes for some objects we don't have enough data we need to save right we need to save bodies okay so some of the companies are in general by creating the data okay so then we clean the data right find the data then we clean the data when we say clean the data means that for example if the size of data we try to make the size of those same right </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_747000_759000_S00"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:12:27.220]</span> SPEAKER_00: for example 60 by 60 this one is not 60 by 60 make the size of those similar </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_759000_999000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:12:39.940]</span> SPEAKER_01: if sometimes maybe we have it anyway this here is not I mean complement we try to complement that right it's not different or we don't have enough data I have this one like I need for example 10 thousand data but I have one time what I can do what I can do I can for example rotate this right rotate in different directions okay this one this right rotate a bit here and create different five angles right it's going to be five of this standard number okay so I can do some increasing the data so three in the data you see like this one and then we try to choose the model which model is good for us what kind of model should I take the decision free rule what is the best model for us okay and then train the model after this say okay in you when you see that two small eyes right and you know ears like this okay and small for example I don't know long tail it's that okay the model gonna recognize that and maybe pass this to the model because all the model just knows numerical values first we need to convert this one to numerical values right how we can convert that because model we just know nothing more than you know real model state values right even know of normal length work we get back to our inputs which should pass like the numeric value I can convert that numeric value say for example 60 by 60 image right 60 by 60 pixels and each pixel has one value red green blue right RGB each RGB z is 0 and 255 okay so it's going to be 60 by 60 and each pixel has three values RGB it's going to be 60 by 60 times 3 times 3 right so what I mean is like this this one I have 64 I mean 64 let's say 64 by 64 which of each this has R GB and r could be 6 ok so I can define this image by 64 by 64 by by 64 and each point going to have 3 lambda! ok so this one is same as right image 1 and then I pass 50 by 50 by 3 vector to my model. Ok? So, and then say, ok, if you have this information, it's going to be cast. And, I mean, for different samples, you do this. </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_999000_1000000_S00"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:16:39.059]</span> SPEAKER_00: Same thing, so, </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1000000_1125000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:16:40.440]</span> SPEAKER_01: train, this one is cast, this one is cast, this one is dog, and so on and so on. Ok, and then we deploy our model. This one is implementation of that. Ok, so define, find your dog, coming in, choose a type of model, train the model, and then again, we want to, after training the model, we pass a new image that we haven't seen. We haven't used the other model. Right? And then, when the model extends, based on the type of learn, it tells that this is cast. Ok? This is called test data. For unseen data. Any questions? Question? Question? Ok. Ok. Thank you. Thank you. </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1125000_1126000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:18:45.640]</span> SPEAKER_02: So, </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1126000_1178000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:18:46.279]</span> SPEAKER_01: what I am going to do, I'm just talking a bit about the fundamentals of Python. Okay? So, first of all, if you want to run your code in Python, what you require, you can use different variables. Okay? Okay? Like PyCharm. Okay? Let's see what we have. Yeah? This one. Okay. We won't have that PyCharm, but you can use PyCharm. So, you can use code. Okay? So, PyCharm. This is PyCharm. You can write on it. So... </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1178000_1195000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:19:38.160]</span> SPEAKER_02: Yep. </a></p>

<p><a name="ts_1204000_1214000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:20:04.940]</span> SPEAKER_01: Here you see that different ID we can use. For example, this code, or visual setting code, is one IDT. Right? </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1214000_1217000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:20:14.039]</span> SPEAKER_02: You need to download it for PyCharm. </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1217000_1220000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:20:17.180]</span> SPEAKER_01: Okay? Here are the three versions or... </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1220000_1222000_S00"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:20:20.180]</span> SPEAKER_00: To me, we need to know. </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1222000_1435000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:20:22.559]</span> SPEAKER_01: PyCharm. Okay. Jupiter Notebook. It's a non -book. Right? If you want to run your code in Python, it's red. And Jupiter Notebook. Spider, like, these three ones are the most common ones. Plus Google Colab. Okay? So, for Google Colab, this means you... ...you can go to Google... ... or Google Colab. And then... ...you'll log in with your email. Okay? If you have like this, then you can create a new notebook. So, notebook means that... ...the document that you created. Right? So, the Python one that you created. Okay?

I I have x y and z is this string string f ok and then just if you want to string ok it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it slash file, it will be 2 .5. 2 .5. Okay? So this one is the reminder mode. Okay? And this one is the publish. Okay? </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1527000_1530000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:25:27.400]</span> SPEAKER_02: So for example, I'm changing this one to </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1530000_1542000_S00"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:25:30.599]</span> SPEAKER_00: 2 and 3. So I'm going to Okay, you see here Let's see, let's just put down, we activate this part. </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1542000_1567000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:25:42.720]</span> SPEAKER_01: Okay? And this is x plus y I think it's 5. Okay. x plus y is y. x minus 5 division. Okay. Integer division. Because 2 y is 3, right? And the reminder is 2. 2 to the power of y. </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1567000_1570000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:26:07.400]</span> SPEAKER_02: So double multiplication </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1570000_1644000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:26:10.240]</span> SPEAKER_01: means 4. Okay. 8. So, if you want to work with this string as I mentioned So, let's deactivate this part and activate this part and activate this part and I want to contact in a cat string with hello So, you can just use plus. Okay? So, let's say name 1 call it name 1 for name and this one as s as hello okay and then I say s plus s plus s plus I think this is small s if you want to you can also name it press okay </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1644000_1669000_S00"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:27:24.779]</span> SPEAKER_00: so hello a </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1669000_1762000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:27:49.960]</span> SPEAKER_01: if you want to if you want to convert this one to uppercase or lowercase so this one is going to the upper let's see that if I run it it's going to be the same but and also and also we have one yeah so this is for so here for number here for string if you want to if you see this one was like a like a here and we want to calculate that one to lower we need to write name it dot i believe lover yeah </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1762000_1774000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:29:22.579]</span> SPEAKER_02: it it it it it it it </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1774000_1780000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:29:34.480]</span> SPEAKER_01: it it we are working with lists ok </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1780000_1788000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:29:40.420]</span> SPEAKER_02: so </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1788000_1817000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:29:48.700]</span> SPEAKER_01: these are some of the things that we can apply so I have a list first of all this should be inside of brackets if you want to print this just print name of the right row if you want to access either of these values like the first value is going to be name of this inside of bracket, index </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1817000_1820000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:30:17.059]</span> SPEAKER_02: so for example first one is going to be a zero </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1820000_1859000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:30:20.440]</span> SPEAKER_01: sorry, number is zero second one is going to be numbers two ok? sometimes we want to print for example from this point on one ok? so from one to end or one to four so we can write numbers one to four means that we skip the phase one ok? so what I mean is like this </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1859000_1860000_S05"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:30:59.700]</span> SPEAKER_05: if </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1860000_1890000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:31:00.660]</span> SPEAKER_01: you have a list let's call that for this number number and we know that here is zero one, two, three, four I don't know, five, six and the values are indexes the values minus two minus five, ten twenty, twenty -five minus six, and </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1890000_1892000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:31:30.579]</span> SPEAKER_02: zero </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1892000_2119000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:31:32.220]</span> SPEAKER_01: ok? and then I want to have access index to the first element just write numbers inside of the bracket so you can print this one sometimes you want to see this one ok? so you need to write numbers and then index to the first element and then index to the second element or maybe you want just this part it's going to be two to four if you want it to the end you can do two ways numbers two, two, six or you can skip this one just write two and then total you understand it means two to n ok? that's one here one to four means one, two, three, four or maybe you can write one, two, nothing ok, if you want to add in new data you can say happen affirmative affirmative affirmative affirmative affirmative side and then open here. Okay, so and then try to run the different functions. Just give me a second. If you want to define a loop, we can do two things. We can use four, four loops, or we can use y. Okay? So, we don't need to define, say, four pi from zero to something. If you have a list, just say four not in numbers. That's enough. We don't need to define the function here. Unlike the, you know, the numbers, you know, other like. This one is if, it fails, this is known. And if you want to define a function, you can use that. And then name of function, and this is the card which I use fast. Of the function. Okay? So, I'm going to go. Okay. So, just download that pi. And, uh, try to run in a little cold out for now. So, it has been done. it has been done. So, So, it has been done. So, it has been done. So, it has been done. it has been done. So, it has been done. So, it has been done. So, it has been done. it has been done. it has been done. it has been done. it has been done. it has been done. it has been done. it </a></p>

<p><a name="ts_2353000_2454000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:39:13.239]</span> SPEAKER_01: Did you log in? So we have this, right? We have two type of different data structures. One is list and one is add. If you want to keep on adding, all you can do is to add your list. So, the first thing we need to do here, so, to define the list, you don't need to input any library, but to define the array, you need to input non -part. The non -part is a library and the first add -in. Okay? So you say two -part numbyte add, and then give just a short name, like the ally, right? This now, like, numbyte is, like, same as the entry, same as numbyte, okay? So, and then, what we're gonna do, if you want to define, let's say, an array, like, add array one, I don't know what's happening, or, okay, so, </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_2454000_2458000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:40:54.539]</span> SPEAKER_02: we say, empty dot, </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_2458000_2572000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:40:58.260]</span> SPEAKER_01: array, and then we pass, the list. Tell me I have a video list about, like, what is the list? Number. Okay? Like, number. Okay? So, we just, hmm? Okay? Alright, so, just say, empty dot array, and we pass through this. Okay? So, we've already defined the number, okay, so I can use the same, now, if you want to add access to each element, the access is gonna be, same as this. You can access to the text element, means, I, sorry, I want, zero, okay? So, I want to print this. I want to print this, and it prints me the text element. from zero to n, means, all elements. Right? Or, from two to n. Hmm, case name, from two to n, right? Or, two to, for example, four. Or, if you write, two to four, it's gonna be, start from two, then three, four. Okay? It's, uh, excluded, four. Okay? Excluded, I see that. </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_2572000_2576000_S00"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:42:52.460]</span> SPEAKER_00: You want to have all of them, </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_2576000_2577000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:42:56.699]</span> SPEAKER_01: but </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_2577000_2582000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:42:57.260]</span> SPEAKER_02: you want to, two, three, four, you need to say, two to five. </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_2582000_2755000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:43:02.699]</span> SPEAKER_01: This last one is excluded, so it shows two, three, and four. Element, two, and, four. Not five, right? Five is excluded. The last one is excluded. That's why you see all these people. So, for now I, just want to show that, okay, what if we have, two array. Okay. So, we create two arrays, array one, and array two. Okay. So, let's see that, if I print, what is the first one, and the second one. So, the first one is the one array, but the second one is two array, like matrix. Right? So, you want to define matrix. while you pass, you pass an array of arrays, but, list of lists, like this one is a list of lists. You have one list, and it's a kind of list, right? It has, first row, and then second. Okay. So, you can create that one, it's going to show this, and this. Okay? and then, what you can do, you want to do, add 10 to each of these elements, or multiply them by two, or you want to find the power of each element, square of each element. So, you need to say, add a one plus 10, add 10 to each element, multiply each element by two, or, square of each element. So, you see here, add a plus 10, 10, and times q, and then, square of each element. square of each element. square of each element. If you want to find the summation of all the elements, write np .sum. It's automatically doing that. You don't need to say, element one plus element two plus, okay? And, so that's why, its number is very useful. Okay? mean and standard division, you can </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_2755000_2759000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:45:55.159]</span> SPEAKER_02: find, all separate. </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_2759000_2849000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:45:59.179]</span> SPEAKER_01: It's a sum, mean, and standard division. Okay? I think we talked about the slicing. Okay? First element, and this one, please, one to four, the ends of each element. This one gonna be, three? One. One, two, two, three. That's four, right? How about this one? Zero. It's gonna be zero, right? Because, end is, one, one, means not included. And before that, it includes all the elements. Okay? Before zero, we don't have this. I believe it doesn't show anything. Oh, trying the, two and, four. Okay, right, one, four. Okay, skipping the, one, three, three, three, </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_2849000_2860000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:47:29.039]</span> SPEAKER_02: three, three, three, </a></p>
<p>Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. how we can define a group. So I mentioned that we have two types of groups here. So, so, we say just number, right? So the number here is a list. We can put that number in numbers, means that all elements in our list, just print that number. Or print NUM plus 5. Okay? So I first print numbers, all the numbers, and then inside of the loop I want to say that. Okay. So, so, so NUM in numbers, print NUM plus 5. Okay. Print that, this and then add, Y for each element. Okay? So, loop is, in the loop, you don't need to define the context. Okay. And Y2, so, this is the Y and then condition. Okay? This is the Y and then condition. Okay? And this one is the if -else, right? If over condition, this one says if over number, model over number is...</p>
