    <p><a name="ts_0_254000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:00:00.000]</span> SPEAKER_01: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. In other words, simply like we have some experience and we want to use that one to include our performance. Okay? So, like we have learned some pattern in the past and we want to use those, right, to include our performance. Okay? In other words, we want to learn a pattern, and the pattern is experiences and based on that one to understand what will be there next. Use that one to include prediction, to reason, and this is that, right? Okay? And for example, you are in this class, you are learning something, but if I add a question, which is in that domain, but follow me. Be comfortable to the fundamentals of that one. You are able to reason that one, right? So it's not just memorizing. So that's the definition of your learning. And when we are talking about the machine learning, we don't feel related to this terminology of learning, but the only thing here is that you want to study the algorithms, right? Rather than numer, you want to... You want to... This learning is done by the machine, so it's a study algorithm, which includes the performance. We call that one as P. So, a given task, it could be a new task, right? Like a regression or classification task. You can task, or maybe class any task, with experience E, with the experience that you have. </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_254000_259000_S00"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:04:14.159]</span> SPEAKER_00: Okay? So that's why each machine learning problem can be... </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_259000_441000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:04:19.560]</span> SPEAKER_01: The task can be defined by this three goal, T, T, E. Okay? Okay? Okay? All right. So... In terms of the why we use machine learning, what is the application and the platform, we know local applications, but in general, like, using machine learning, you can still make experience, it doesn't exist. For example, you want to navigate on Mars, right? So probably, like, you have some images, but, like, suppose that's running on Mars, right? And then you are, I don't know, just walking there? And you don't have any idea about objects. You don't know that's, is it kind of like, wall? Is it kind of like, this object, is something to experience you to walk? Right? All you can do, you can take a picture of, uh, imaging on Mars, and you train a model, and that is, you know, what is the type of data? So what we need, we need to have a deep dataset first. Based on that one, we train our model, and then, you know, predict that on all the same objects. Okay? So, that's where, that's why human expertise doesn't exist here, right? Because human movement cannot detect them. Uh, because we don't have information, but we can train a model. So, also, like, human cannot explain the expertise, right? Like, it's a piece of recognition. Okay? So, when you are talking with someone, you know that, what is this, like, if, like, I'm talking about this, if somebody asks you that, can you explain what was that word? So, you know that, like, it's basically, or, let's say, uh, naturally, you want to understand what is that word? Like, if someone asks me that, what was it, what was it, like, a characteristic of that, like, a word? So, it's not easy to explain, but for machines, it's easy to explain. So, you say, okay, whenever you see the frequency like this, okay, so that's this character. The character A's frequency is like this. B is like this. O is like this. Right? So, the machine can explain that one. But </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_441000_447000_S00"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:07:21.220]</span> SPEAKER_00: if you ask me that, okay, how did, I don't know, like a whiteboard, </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_447000_802000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:07:27.220]</span> SPEAKER_01: what is a whiteboard? So, you know what is a whiteboard? If you want to explain that, it's not easy. Because you need to say, okay, here W is the history frequency, that, very good. But for machines, it's easy. Right? So, that's why. When you want to, like, do a speech recognition, if somebody's talking, right, like, I'm talking to ChatGPT, and ChatGPT can recognize my voice, right? Or, sorry, or whatever, right? So, like, Amazon, Alex, right? So, what's happening, for some of us, we have given a lot of, let's say, the speech to the machine, right? And then machine train on that one. And now, when I'm talking, can be coordinates. I think this is in high level, but for each, like, let's say, the volume, or every word that I'm talking, it has its own frequency. So, we can write for each word, and say, this is labeled A, so, for A, the frequency is like this. We have provided that one to the machine. The machine understands that. Okay? That's why everyone, like, every time that you are talking to the machine, can recognize. Okay? Passive by letter, right? So, it's a speech field in the machine, right? It's called speech recognition. And it's like a neural network, but rather than images, it takes the voices. Okay? That's why that is. It's not easy to get data, because the format of data and speech is different, right? And if you think about the, you know, those frequencies. Or, like, sometimes, you want to use machine learning for customizing the models, and that means that, like, suppose I've got two patients, right? So, what's wrong for patient is different from the other patient. Like, I don't know, like, genes are different, DNAs are different, so probably they have the same symptoms. But you can say that, like, for this patient and for this patient, the action from the machine should be the same. Okay? It should be, you might be different. In general, it can be the same, but it should be customized patient to patient. Okay? That's where the machine can do, uh, that's more accurate than you. Sometimes you want, you have a huge amount of the data, like, generally, you say, right? So, you know that, like, every person has the many, like, a very weak number of genes, right? And then if you have those data, it's not easy. Even if it's for genetics, right, uh, I mean, a person who's the expert, uh, has the, uh, expert problem. Is the expert problem, uh, genetics, it's not easy to analyze those genes. Okay? So, because we have it, like, a, I don't know, like, probably a million or a million, or, uh, like, it's not like, just that I need to, in terms of the number, I don't know if it's a million or a million, but it's, I know that it's very big number of, uh, um, characteristics. So, in these days, it's not easy for a person to just, uh, you know, analyze all of them. But machines can do that one. Right? We can provide a big data to our, uh, model, and that model, like, we can train and predict what would be the, what would be the, uh, possibility for, uh, thinking, uh, I mean, uh, genes. So, when we have a huge amount of the data, that's the issue then, uh, very well. I think each of those shows one of the, like, this one is for a split representation, right? This one is probably navigating on the log for the first option, and so on and so forth. This one is example of . Any other example that machine learning, uh, is used and performed better, other than this? So, there are state -of -the -art applications of machine learning, and so on and so forth. So, we can use the same, the whole scar, as in essence, right? So, based on the machine learning algorithms, uh, to detect objects. Okay? So, for example, we might have, the whole scar might have different sensors, uh, sensors for, like, cameras, sensors, uh, 360 -degree laser, and GPS, this is all. So, all of them are used to sensing data, and </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_802000_811000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:13:22.080]</span> SPEAKER_02: based on sensing, like, if you do my death one to the model inside of this, I mean, uh, the algorithm, if you have, or </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_811000_926000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:13:31.779]</span> SPEAKER_01: autonomous car, and you can predict that, what is the output, okay? It clears them for these objects, right? Clear? Alright. Okay. So, I think this one is also about the, autonomous car, technologies, uh, we want to, this is what I want to say, that we play with, within the headline. Uh, I think these are for, not today, but, uh, you know, that's, like, since 2000, especially, uh, 17, 16, on one, we put these in the headline, I talked about that one last week, and, uh, that's, uh, the level in physics and chemistry, that's 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, you know, for the higher end of the, right? So, and also, this is an example that probably, you know, like, uh, an image, uh, can be detected. For example, suppose that we have, for face, uh, let's say, detection. For example, we have this guy, right? And we want to know that who's that guy, okay? Or we want to know that what is the gesture, like, smiling, crying, this is how. Right? So what we can do, we can pass our raw data, which is the main, to this raw element. And the responsibility of this raw element, which is that, gives us that, what is this, how, what is the example? Like, who's this guy? Or, is he smiling, crying, or whatever, right? So we pass it to neural network, and neural network, uh, let's say, </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_926000_926000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:15:26.740]</span> SPEAKER_02: we </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_926000_936000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:15:26.879]</span> SPEAKER_01: take that, uh, I mean, provide some output to us. But how it works, it's easy. </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_936000_937000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:15:36.600]</span> SPEAKER_02: We </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_937000_960000_S00"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:15:37.000]</span> SPEAKER_00: have this image. We know that image means that something sucks. Right? So, and for each pixel, we have RGV values. So, simply, an image is nothing more than neural networks. Right? Suppose that this one is 60 by 60. So it's gonna be 60 by 60 array. And each </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_960000_1135000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:16:00.899]</span> SPEAKER_01: element of array is gonna have, gonna have the RGV value. R is something between 0 to 255, E0 to 255, and D as well. Right? It depends on the, uh, I mean, uh, intensity of those, like, that could be light point, or it could be, uh, dark or something. Okay? So we can provide our image, which is nothing more than I am, uh, like, at, let's say, the RGV values. Okay? 60 by 60 times 3, for example. And then, now, it passes over the neural network. The neural network has different layers. Okay? And each layer has its own responsibility. Okay? So, for example, the first layer is responsible to detect the edges. Okay? I have some edges like this. Okay? So, for example, this image, and some edges here, right? Edges, edges, right? So, in the first layer, as you see, like, the edges are detected. And then, edges pass to the next layer. So, in the next layer, neural network puts these edges together, beside each other, and, uh, try to find some objects. For example, putting together all these edges to create some circles. Okay? Or rectangles, or triangles, right? So, and then, uh, by combining the edges. And after that one, then we have all of this, I mean, object, put them together to detect that, uh, object. Right? So, I just want to mention that it's something like this. We are thinking that, like, when I'm looking at two, this line, what I can think about that, first thing is that I, I depict the, uh, let's say edges. And they put these edges together to create some, for example, circles. And then I say that the person who has, I don't know, uh, or the object who has this type of, I mean, circles, and the face is, like, I don't know, let's say, mostly we are focusing on the eyes, right? So, like, this is the position of eyes, and that's why it's mapping. So, so, the person said the edges, then combining those edges, and actually combining those edges, the, uh, the, uh, the green background harder. Okay? So, the first layer, layers are lower level. </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1135000_1137000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:18:55.759]</span> SPEAKER_02: Okay? </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1137000_1222000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:18:57.319]</span> SPEAKER_01: And, uh, it's not more understandable. But when we go to the next layer, it's more understandable. Ok? Question? Any question? For example, we have different neural networks, but one of the neural networks is deep belief net. It's a type of neural network. Ok? It's the name of neural network. And we have a similar thing here. We see like the edges, and putting those edges together, and the same here. Animals, we have to work like the chips, like the chair, this stuff. Like suppose that we have like we want to know that this one is a chair or not. What we do, first we detect the edges, and then based on that one we know that the we can pretend together to recognize the basis of the chair. And then we say, oh, ok, if I see such an object like that, which has four and the bases, it's most likely going to be a chair. Ok? </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1222000_1222000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:20:22.400]</span> SPEAKER_02: Ok? </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1222000_1237000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:20:22.920]</span> SPEAKER_01: Ok, so that's the same thing. Like, the first thing is that we need to train a model. We need to train a neural network, for example, multiple objects. Ok? So, and we </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1237000_1238000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:20:37.220]</span> SPEAKER_02: want to know that what is </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1238000_1241000_S00"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:20:38.480]</span> SPEAKER_00: the type of that object. Is it the, </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1241000_1277000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:20:41.099]</span> SPEAKER_01: each of those types is called one plus. Is it the car? Is it the face? Is it motorbike? Is it the airplane? And so on and so forth. So, first layer. So, we have the first layer. In first layer we have a major major major, like other edges. Right? Edges of the images. It's the first, the responsibly, the first layer. Second layer is the shared features. And object specific features. So, the first layer is getting more, I know that third layer is more space -based features. Right? </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1277000_1289000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:21:17.059]</span> SPEAKER_02: So, as I mentioned, I get eyes and then glass. The third layer is, between all these eyes, yours and son, of course, in, in, </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1289000_1345000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:21:29.619]</span> SPEAKER_01: and then, it has some high level features. Make sense? Ok. Good. So, this is an eye, example, just for detecting objects, and the road, and if they call it whatever, which is used by, and this part, not just for the, not just for the images, but for the scene available. For the whole scene. Ok? I think there are, different examples here. This one is for speech recognition. As we see always, we have our input, and we have a model, and then it generates the, somewhat different. Ok. So, these are, </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1345000_1358000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:22:25.400]</span> SPEAKER_02: the impact of, machine learning, right? Specifically, deep learning, using speech technology, like, like, three, or, </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1358000_1512000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:22:38.299]</span> SPEAKER_01: like, galaxy, and this is, ok. So, but, let's first focus on this one. I think last time, last session, I talked about this, that we go, right? So, I mentioned that we have a, what's it, which is called AR. Machine learning is just a part of that. Okay? So, beside the machine learning, we might have, expert systems, not used anymore, but, some part of the, or, we might have, fuzzy computing, right? Uh, we might have robotics, these are all the, branches of the, AI. One branch of AI is machine learning. And, deep learning is just a part of that. Ok? So, beside the deep learning, we might have other algorithms, which like, the traditional algorithms, linear regression, let's say, decision trees, SPM, clustering algorithms, and so on and so forth. Ok? Any question on this slide? It's, like a, I mean, if it's not clear, just let me know, and, I can explain. Ok. So, you're focusing on this, machine learning. And later, you're going to go to, in this case. Ok? So, I'm getting, this is fine. So, ok. So, what we, what we want to, learn here, with respect to, ML basics, is, we want to know the connection between, ML, and, what they are, and, right? And also, like, if we consider that, machine learning has a big category, big, big, right? Or big universe, let's say, it has, it has a machine, right? So, I mean, if we consider that, AI is a big, we have a machine learning, in the core, so, machine learning itself, </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1512000_1521000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:25:12.579]</span> SPEAKER_02: is divided in, three, category of, algorithms. Some of those are called, supervised, </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1521000_1893000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:25:21.859]</span> SPEAKER_01: some of those are called, unsupervised, and also, reinforcement learning. Ok? What is this kind? For each of those, also we have different algorithms here. For example, for supervised, we have the recreational classification, we have the, we have the, and for unsupervised, it could be clustering, it could be dimensionality reduction. Ok? And for reinforcement learning, we have different algorithms, human learning, and this is stuff. So, in high level, like, supervised learning, I believe, last time, I mentioned, whenever our data, has some labels, for example, we want to predict their, the, price of house, in downtown Vancouver. So, you already have some, story about the thing, like, for each property, you know the price of that. Ok? Like, each property has, three bedroom, two bedroom, I don't know, like the number of, bathroom, right? The level, is it a condo, or it's home, and based on that, you have all the price. Ok? And, suppose that rather than one, property, you have, 10 ,000 properties. So, for each property, you have some features, about that property, and one column, which is the net price of. That column is called, target. What you are going to do, you want to, trigger the problem, is getting, like, features, about one, new property, that you don't have the price of that one, and try to, predict that, target. Ok? Make sense? Here, our data is called, supervised. Why supervised? Because, our data, isn't labeled. I have, for each record, I have, what is the target of that. Make sense? Because, our data, is, but sometimes, it's not like that. We don't have the target values. We have just some features, about each data. And, we can't run, supervised algorithms. We need to go to unsupervised algorithms. Right? So, for example, we have some, like, suppose a solution, like a, social network. Right? So, some people, are interested in, some of the people, are, I mean, similar to each other. Right? They, have a similar interest. They want to watch, they want to watch, they want to watch, they want to watch, they want to watch movies. Right? So, they interest on similar features. But, they are not labeled. We haven't labeled both. Okay? So, we have some data, but we don't have the label for this. So, what we do here, we take those data, and try to classify, those data, into different, uh, clusters. Right here. Suppose that, we have this class, and I know that, like this guy, and this guy, and this guy, because these are, in terms of the interest. So, all these people, here is going to be one cluster, here is going to be one cluster, or, like that part is one cluster, and so on. Right? So, the type of, clustering here, is based on the similarity. The similarity could be, in terms of interest, or any similarity, that you want to define, depends on the context. Make sense? Okay. So, here, we say that, our data is not super wide, and we apply, plus it. Another, another, range of our super wide, is, dimensionality reduction. So, suppose that, you have a data set, and, with that data set, you have, I don't know, 20k, record, and each record has, uh, 1 ,000 features. Okay? So, some of these features, are not important. some of these features, are just, they don't have impact, on the predicting of the target. So, what we can do, we can, reduce the dimensionality, of our data, not in terms of the number of records, but in terms of the number of records, how we look at the data. So, how we can do, we can ask, why the radiationality reduction algorithms, or PCA. Okay? Any questions? So, for supervised learning, we have, we have, we have regression, and we have regression, and identity. And we have another category, which is, called, we have regression, we have reinforcement learning, and we have another category, which is, we don't focus too much, on reinforcement learning, in this class. But in general, reinforcement learning, means that, coming from there. Okay, so, maybe from the experience, but, let's say that, you are in an island, okay, and, everything is unknown for you. You don't have any experience. You just got there, and everything is new for you. How you can, how you learn, how to adapt yourself to it. Right? How do you adapt yourself to it? </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1893000_1895000_S06"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:31:33.960]</span> SPEAKER_06: Try an error, right? </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_1895000_2327000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:31:35.940]</span> SPEAKER_01: Try an error. Just try an error. So, for example, you see some object, okay, just you touch that one, you try to eat that one. Okay? Maybe you like it, maybe you don't like it. If you don't like it, next time, move your heart, you don't like that one. Right? You're not right. Okay? So, based on each action, to the environment, you're going to get the punishment, or rewired. Okay? So, if it's a punishment, you try to, decrease the chance of selecting that action next time. If you say, rewired, you increase the chance of probability of selecting that action. Okay? Next time. So, that's why, like, it's for, you know, in fact, right? So, when they want to, like, how they do, just punch or sensing something, and, it depends on the, action from the environment, or they feel that this one is hot. The next time, they don't punch it, right? Okay? So, this is the concept, like, the, the reinforcement learning, like, is derived from that, and that's, basically, you have one agent, and you have environment, you can use some action, on the environment, and each time, you see that, what is the penalty for, punishment from the environment. Okay? And, depends on that one, the list of actions, the importance, can be obtained. And then, like, what is the best policy here? The best policy is, like, selecting optimal actions. Okay? So, it always means that, the sequence of actions, or the information, or the information. And, it's final point. Okay. We have some other examples. We have also this one with the story of AI and what is AI. We just have to start this one with the right. And if you're going to have some interviews, and you think of machine learning, NLT, you can see the computer, the robot, the planning, the planning, the planning, the planning, the planning, the planning, so on and so forth. So what is a deep learning? Deep learning is a kind of learning. Deep learning model which derived from the power plants. So a deep learning algorithm, what you think is that? Deep learning algorithms, basically, you are used for images. Okay? If your data is in the format of NH, you use deep learning. It's not used too much for some context like tabular data. Like for example, like for prediction the price of the house, right? For prediction. Here our data is not enough. Here our data is the tabular. We don't use machine learning. We don't, sorry, we don't use the plural learning. Nature. Okay? If you do that one, it can return the output for us, but maybe it's not too much accurate. Okay? But some, for some context, object detection or ALP, right? Or speech recognition. Uh, deep learning is the tools, which is . It stands? So if you take a tabular data, other traditional condition, then, like, uh, decision, or less means, but maybe data is in format of images, speech, or, uh, text, process, you want to do text processing, that's better to use the . Okay. So, have you taken the statistic kind of course? Yeah? And then you're here. Then you're on the graph course, alright? You had the statistics. So, it might be question, because, like, if you remember statistics, first all I should say is that statistics is the kind of, like, basic function of the . Alright? Because the reason is that you need to know about the stats, like, I don't know, for analysis of the data, alright? So, you need to know what is the average, what is the . Sorry, next time you should comment below. This is the turn of time you are calling late. If you're not certain, calling late, don't . I mean, what was the change here for the . For the other class, you were late class, alright? Okay. So, we want to mention about the definition, the difference between the . and the statistics, right? So, statistics is the basic of the machine learning, okay? Because we need to know that for analyzing analysis of the data, we need to know what is the average, what is the standard we need, alright? So, this is all, right? So, that's why, part of machine learning is also related to data analysis. Okay. So, but, how they are different from each other. For the statistics, we need to find, we want to find the relationship between some people and some others. Okay. So, for example, I have some data, and then I want to know that, does how this smoking, for example, has any impact on cancer? Okay. We want you to find a kind of relationship here. And we analyze our data, we need the </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_2327000_2337000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:38:47.579]</span> SPEAKER_02: statistics, and then we say that, yes, there is a relationship between smoking and cancer, but how much is significant. </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_2337000_2403000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:38:57.239]</span> SPEAKER_01: Is it significant or not? Right? At the end, we will, the statistics, we can raise on this. Okay? The machine learning is more about the prediction. Okay? Like, for example, we want to know that, if I smoke, what would be my lifestyle? Okay? How many years do I do? Right? So, or, like, even the, I mean, some, I want to predict what would be the, uh, stop tomorrow. Okay? Or temperature tomorrow. The idea is the prediction of the cancer. So, that is, at least, if you want to just analyze, or find any relationship between who and how could. Yeah? And, uh, just, you want to say, oh, is there any relationship or not? And is there any relationship, how much, significant, like that? Yes, correct me, please. But, um, </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_2403000_2409000_S06"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:40:03.179]</span> SPEAKER_06: the statistic has a regression analysis. So, then, question, where do you actually do the one different? </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_2409000_2610000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:40:09.519]</span> SPEAKER_01: I mentioned that one, like if, you know, like if, statistics is a part of, like, the basic, like mass. Right? So, you need to learn mass to use that one in physics, for example. Right? But, if you need, this is like the basic, and we should end in this high level. Like, in terms of the linear regression, if you use a linear regression to find just a relationship, it's only using the pure statistic. But, if you use that one to prediction the output, I mean the prediction that, predict the output, it's gonna be, uh, example of the pushing. And, some, some, some of the have over that. But, pushing learning is kind of like higher level. You have one layer here, and the machine learning is on top of that one. Machine learning uses the statistics. Right? Makes sense? But, statistics is not using the machine learning. Something like, something like this. We have the stats, in low level, and then we expect machine learning to use it. So, machine learning uses this one, but it's not like this. Right? Because, machine learning is in low science. Statistics is something that's provided to the use. Right? So, in other words, machine learning is application of the statistics. Now, you see that stats more interpret, uh, interpreting relationships and bringing friends. However, machine learning is about accurate prediction. Any questions? Good question. Yeah. Okay. So, okay. I mentioned that we have supervised, we have unsupervised, we have lean -person learning. Okay? And, we have semi -supervised learning sometimes. It's not very common. In some context, maybe you'll see this one. Maybe sometimes you don't see that one, but, so let's say, supervised is that we have some trading data, and for each data we have its target, or data. Right? Like, example was the prediction of the, uh, uh, uh, uh, prices of the profiles. Okay? Unsupervised is that you have just trading data, but you don't have any data. You have some data that you think you want to just separate. Right? So, for example, like the social network in other words, like, we have some friends in social network, they're connected to each other. Right? So, we have a lot of data that we have, but they are not connected to other people. Right? Here, we </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_2610000_2613000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:43:30.760]</span> SPEAKER_02: don't have any labels. Based on who is a friend of </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_2613000_2644000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:43:33.320]</span> SPEAKER_01: other, right? Like, I'm a friend of you, you're a friend of, and so I'm a friend of you, you know, right? So, but there's no connection here and there, so it's going to be two different clusters. So, that's why in unsupervised learning, we don't have any labels. We want to create both labels using our clusters. Okay? Semi -supervised means the supervised, but some of the records doesn't have the output. </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_2644000_2653000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:44:04.139]</span> SPEAKER_02: In reality, let's say 80 % of the records have the label, but 20 % doesn't have it. Okay? So, </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_2653000_2789000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:44:13.139]</span> SPEAKER_01: that would be important as I mentioned, learning from the rewards. Okay? Learning from the rewards and penalty events. It's given by the people I don't have to reach out. Okay? So, for supervised learning, here's an example here. So, the first problem, the first problem is in your case. Okay? So, whenever you problem is supervised and your target is a close number, real number, real number, okay? It is called regression. y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y So, that's the classification. However, if you want to have this score, because you are 100, like it could be, for example, 85 .5, 89 .5, 95. Okay, so, in that case, the problem is a problem which could be solved using this supervised learning model. Because your target here is not class. You can't imagine that, like how many numbers between 0 and 100. Right here on how many numbers. Okay. </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_2789000_2809000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:46:29.360]</span> SPEAKER_02: So. </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_2809000_2876000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:46:49.599]</span> SPEAKER_01: Suppose that each of these points, you see the blue points. Right? So, each of these points shows their gear. And the other one shows the sea, the Arctic sea level. Right? Like, ice level. Okay. Yeah. Just this Arctic sea ice level. Okay. So, it wants to show that, like for example, in 1980, the level of ice was higher. Okay. And this one is a million squared kilometer. So, around 7 .2 million squared kilometer. Okay. And then, like later, in 1982, for example, it's decreased. </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_2876000_2878000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:47:56.039]</span> SPEAKER_02: And you see that it's going to drop. </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_2878000_3242000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:47:58.860]</span> SPEAKER_01: And these days, we know that the level of that, like all the ice is on the right. And they're not. Okay. So, there's a pattern. You want to see that, this one is a regression problem. Why? Because this one is our input. And this one is our output. Okay. And our output is float number. Okay. So, that's why it's a regression problem. Okay. What we are doing here, we want to see that, can I feed a model, and I feed a function or model, like when I'm talking about the model, simply use a function. Can I feed a function, which try to, you know, cover most of these points, right? Okay. I know that probably sometimes we have some errors. But we want to find the best function. Okay. Maybe I can think about the statement, like a linear function. Or maybe I can, because here you see that it's not that much linear. So, here, like the relationship is not that much linear, they are ups and downs. So, can I think about the nonlinear function? Or nonlinear model? All of them is possible. But, what is important is that, the line of the function that's, the nonlinear function that you fit, it should have the nonlinear function. Okay. What I mean here is that, we take this point, and here, it's, the line of the choice is 3 .5. But, the model tells me that, based on this, the prediction is 4 points. Right? So, for this one, there are some errors. But, if I take this point, which is for, let's say, 2008, a, the ground truth, and also prediction by the model is the same. Right? The error is 0. So, in other words, like, the distance between prediction of the model and the ground truth is 0. the minimum for all the points. Okay? So, if you find the error for all the points, that number should be small number. That's a good number. If you, you're getting a bigger number, it shows that, if it's a function, but there are big errors on the left one. Right? Make sense? This is an example of regression. But, what we have, our data is almost always on this format. X and Y. This is X, and this is Y. Y always is one value. But, X can be more than one feature. So, X is a number. So, to predict the, I mean, level of rise, maybe you think about the year, you think about the location, and so on and so forth. Right? So, I consider the year and the location to predict the rise level. So, here, my X, X1, has two values. It's kind of like, let's say, yeah, two values. It might be a big one. And X is always the same. X10 is the same. But, these guys should be just always one value. That's why you target, maybe with one value, but X can be a big one. It's not a scholar. So, I think, I'll get to this color. But, X, for our inputs, can be big. So, I think, I'll get to this color. And that's, okay. I think, we're going to have another example here. Maybe, I can show. Okay. Maybe, I'll get to this color. Okay. Yeah. Like this one. Right? So, you want to predict the house price. This one is usually. So, you want to predict the Y. And this feature, like the square footage of house, number of bedrooms, weight, altogether is your X. It's not just one feature. That's true. But, only target is just one. Right? Make sense? So, probably you just consider only square footage to predict the block. But, that data is kind of like moving. Not each. We have other features here, which are important for us. Help us to predict the price. Accurate. Right? So, why not? Why we shouldn't use that. Okay. So, that's why, like always, what we have as X, can be big. Four. Just one feature. Okay. So, you want to predict the, I mean, Isler. So, this </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_3242000_3243000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:54:02.760]</span> SPEAKER_02: is very, very, very, very. </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_3243000_3316000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:54:03.599]</span> SPEAKER_01: So, if you want to predict the, this one shows that, okay. So, suppose that we have some images. And, it shows that what is the tumor size. And, based on that one, we want to know that, that type of, I mean, tumor, means like a, it's a kind of normal, malignant cancer, or just a, uh, denny. That means that, like, serious or not. Okay? So, we have two classes. Serious, not serious. Right? So, based on the size of tumor, you want to predict that, that type of tumor cancer is serious or not serious. Okay? So, this problem is called classification. You look at the tumor size and based on that one, you say that it's a serious or not serious. Okay? </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_3316000_3318000_S00"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:55:16.860]</span> SPEAKER_00: Or, maybe based </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_3318000_3323000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:55:18.500]</span> SPEAKER_02: on the features of the customer, you want to say that that customer is </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_3323000_3416000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:55:23.559]</span> SPEAKER_01: risky or not risky. Okay? We are looking at the profile of the customer. Just about the salary, about the, I don't know what it is, neighborhood, education, all of them together. So, we are looking at the profile of the customer. So, we are looking at the profile of the customer. So, that's the classification. Like this one. Okay? Here, again, our targets are small values. Okay? I'm gonna get a year to be gone. I'm gonna get a year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to year to ok so how we can classify this one for example I can say that I can consider a line like this ok so in simple words if our target value is category is called classification if it's like a </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_3416000_3417000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:56:56.679]</span> SPEAKER_02: limited number </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_3417000_3428000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:56:57.679]</span> SPEAKER_01: like float number it's gonna be make sense? yes? </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_3428000_3443000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:57:08.280]</span> SPEAKER_02: anyone else? any questions? ok ok </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_3443000_3586000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:57:23.320]</span> SPEAKER_01: ok sometimes as I mentioned x can be more than one feature two more size and age ok so based on two more size and age small or small serious or not serious so that's why like our two good features can be one few or more than two features so again here is example of the classic like other features like thickness, cell size, cell shape, all of them can be important to understand that not just the two more size, shape, probably thickness and size as well and as well as age ok so ok so what if our data is not labor like this you see there is no name you label of any color you have got just some data ok you have some raw data you don't have any label and the ask here is that same grouping together the question is yes I try to group them for example in two three clusters two clusters one and two ok so if we keep here this one is bigger because I know that this guy are close to each other so he provides guys are close to each other and this guy are close to each other so I'm going to have three clusters okay B and C and now I have different regions I didn't have all of these regions right just to move ok three stands ok so in other words the idea here is that I look at the data and I want to find any hidden structure this idea of the data that hidden structure for example is that </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_3586000_3590000_S00"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:59:46.980]</span> SPEAKER_00: these guys are similar to each other </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_3590000_3594000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:59:50.719]</span> SPEAKER_01: because they are close to each other ok this </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_3594000_3612000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:59:54.159]</span> SPEAKER_02: closeness can be the distance between the point but the different context can be I mean can change right so the example of the social media the closeness of two points means how much the interest of close to two points </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_3612000_3800000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[01:00:12.539]</span> SPEAKER_01: like the type of looking at right so it's not like exactly the difference between the two points between the two points the distance between the two points the distance in terms of the similarity right similarity of the details so this is an example of the clustering but we have other type of unsupervised learning like dimensionality reduction which is PCA here autoencoders power clustering and unalonging detection association rules and so on and so forth but the most important one is this two clustering and dilution y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y for example of the unsupervised learning I will leave you to the students based on the genetic similarity okay here we have other examples this one is the social network analysis that I mentioned these are more connected to each other these are friends of each other or like if we have a good example of clustering is the market segmentation we want to segment our customers based on their similarity I don't know we want to go over here some of the customers are online some of the customers are in person customers or maybe we have all of them are online but some of those are looking for some specific so we can we can do some segmentation depends on that request okay so or I mean cluster computing organizing those clusters all of these nodes </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_3800000_3804000_S00"><span style="color:#78909C">[01:03:20.179]</span> SPEAKER_00: are for example on astronomer </a></p>

<p><a name="ts_3895000_3897000_S00"><span style="color:#78909C">[01:04:55.190]</span> SPEAKER_00: and then </a></p>

<p><a name="ts_3922000_3925000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[01:05:22.780]</span> SPEAKER_02: then based on the reward and the </a></p>

<p><a name="ts_4038000_4041000_S00"><span style="color:#78909C">[01:07:18.260]</span> SPEAKER_00: learning and the idea here is that select the actions </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_4041000_4145000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[01:07:21.139]</span> SPEAKER_01: to maximize the future all together the idea here is that i live in that island with more rewards y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y The state is called SK, so SK is just a current state and we have your set. You can always select the state from that set. We have the set of actions, we call that current pattern command, and we just select which is the one of those. And the reward is also the set, and each time it gives some values. 0 .9, 0 .8, it would mean be one. And the next state. So here, I do action in T, I got the reward, and I go to the new state. Here, I do the next action, I got reward with NLP, and I go to the state key from that. I got the reward. Yeah? Clear? Okay. This is the </a></p>

This is the function method. This function method is used to get the feedback, which actually can be used. For example, if you predict something, and you add a real function method there, the function of the function method there, the function method says how much the result that you are given is in the function method. In the function method. Okay? So, here, that's the function method. So, here, we have an agent, and we have an audit there, but we are in interaction. So, we have an application called, in force </a></p>

<p><a name="ts_4539000_4542000_S00"><span style="color:#78909C">[01:15:39.619]</span> SPEAKER_00: so I have three categories </a></p>

In sense? So for numeric values okay why you can you understand that? Suppose that rather than 0, 1 or rather than 1, 3, 4 like 1 ,000 some saying we have some classes some saying we have some classes plus A, B, C, D, E, E, okay? If you really doesn't understand that category, what do you need to do? Or if you really understand the sum of the algorithm doesn't understand that like neural network doesn't understand that </a></p>

Suppose that I have 20 type of cars how to give the number to them? Like I have two numbers on the end like whatever whatever right? So then should I give one to Toyota and two to the other one? What would be the issue in that case? You know what I mean? I'm talking about this part I'm talking about categories right? Like let's say that I have uh we call it as yeah model okay so I have Toyota </a></p>

So, I mentioned that for this guy I need to keep some new range values. So, if I define something like this, okay, let's try to get into 1, this one has 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And what I want to predict is the failure, right? So, besides this information, I have other information like page of customer, 20, 25, 30, 23, 25, 40, okay, and experience, zero experience, maybe 2 years, 5 years, 8 years, 2 years, 5 years, and 10. Okay? And I have this information, and then, it's 2 ,000, 2 ,500, let's say, people. It's 2 ,500, okay, and this one, 2, 2, this one, Oh, 2, 2 years, year, year, year,!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ! and this one is this and this one is this. and this one is this. Okay?

So, I have a model for functions, you can use a function, right? That function takes this feature, this feature, this feature, and this one should be followed by. Okay? So let's say for example, h times something, plus car model times something, plus x payas times something, and the output is going to be 30, right? Okay? So, first of all, f function, not the node trace of your gm, and this is that. I need to be solved normally, like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. What is the potential issue here? The model to interpret this number is not as a class, but as a value. As a value, okay. So if they are value, what's the issue? Some false calculations, like this place, five, </a></p>

<p><a name="ts_5332000_5470000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[01:28:52.420]</span> SPEAKER_01: . Yeah, true, yeah, it's great. Okay, so we are given weight, right? When given weight, we say that this one is like six, this one is one. Means that this here is six times important than . Right? It's not in reality. All of them, like a, it's not like this. But maybe, there are some other, I mean, type of encoding. So this type of encoding is not correct. We call this one as label encoding. So, this is called label encoding and that's not true. That's not true. Okay? So there are two other ways for this one. Let's say that one major one is called one hot encoding. Okay? One hot encoding encoding and the other one is the copy. So let's focus on that one. So the issue, like here is that. So this is the encoding, right? This is encoding. This is encoding. And encoding means that connecting the categories to the way of travel. This is not the correct way. So, what is the correct way? Okay? So, let's go here. So, suppose that I have three categories. Red, green, blue. Okay? So, the first method of encoding is the one hot encoding. What we do, so, we try, we want to encode this one. I have the first state as red. So, I have the color of the color. The other one is green. And blue. How many colors do I have? Three colors. Okay? So, I'm going to create three </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_5470000_5482000_S00"><span style="color:#78909C">[01:31:10.380]</span> SPEAKER_00: columns here. This one is for red. This one is for green. And this one is for blue. </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_5482000_5656000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[01:31:22.199]</span> SPEAKER_01: I have gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone So, for the other record, its color is green. So the second one is going to be blue. Okay? And this one is going to be blue. Okay? So, in other words, in our example, if I want to convert that one to 100 code, what I need to do, rather than throw it off, I'm going to have one, two, three, four, five, six, six columns, so it's going to be one, others zero. And the second one is going to be one, others zero. Okay? I'm so honest with you. In that case, we don't have the concept like which one is green or not. Okay? We don't have such a concept. Make sense? Okay. So, this is called one -hot encoding. The other method is that, similar to one -hot encoding, but we try to remove the last category. Okay? Suppose that here we have three categories. Okay? So, I remove one of the categories, so that's, and, like, I say, red. So, one and zero. Three, the second one. For blue, none of those. If I have such a thing, I don't need two, the third column. All right? Because, if I have such a thing, I just have to say, this one, and this one is zero, of course, this one is zero. Okay? That's why, like, we call that one, domain coding, and one thing of domain coding is that it reduces, you know, number of cells. I mean, so another example here is that, like, I have four Cp, Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary, Montreal. Okay? So, because I have four Cp, I'm gonna have, in one -hot encoding, I'm gonna have one, four columns. Okay? Toronto, one. Other zero. Vancouver, this one, one. Other zero. Calgary, Montreal. Now, I want to convert that one to domain coding. That means that, I consider I remove this one. What this one says. Here is parental. Here is Vancouver. Here is Calvin. Here is none of them. So, </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_5656000_5656000_S02"><span style="color:#78909C">[01:34:16.300]</span> SPEAKER_02: that </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_5656000_5736000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[01:34:16.539]</span> SPEAKER_01: means that our last category. There is something. Okay? So, if you have K category, K category, in one -hot encoding, you're gonna have K columns. But, in dummy encoding, you're gonna have K minus one columns. That's it. And, of course, we'll read the same features. Right? If we have more columns, for the model, it's difficult. So, that's why dummy is, in some contexts, used that. Any question on this? So, I think this is a very good example, which shows that, like, it depends on the context. On text, we can use 100 encoding, or we can use the dummy encoding. Label encoding is the last thing. We don't use it. Maybe. Alright. Yeah. </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_5736000_5741000_S00"><span style="color:#78909C">[01:35:36.939]</span> SPEAKER_00: Label encoding is okay to use as a target. </a></p>
<p><a name="ts_5741000_5925000_S01"><span style="color:#78909C">[01:35:41.359]</span> SPEAKER_01: It's okay. Because it says one, two, three, four, five. So, for the input features, we don't use it. Got it? So, for target, it's okay to use it. Okay. So, number of columns here is K. This one is K minus one, as we discussed. Right? Okay. And we use the one -hutting coding on models like tree -based and depleting models. But for linear regression, and we just did regression that we don't discuss, we use the dummy encoding. Okay? Okay. Because we want to use the one -hutting coding in this model. We're going to have the issue of the multi -coli -linear tissue. That means that, like, if you have three features, the third features can be dependent by the oscillation of the first -size. Right? Like this one. Like this one. If you want to find the value for this, this is always one minus summation of the other. So, this one is one minus summation of the other. So, this problem is called multi -coli -linear tissue. And we're going to have that one in one -hutting coding, but here we don't have that tissue. Right? So, that's why, like, the problem model is tree -based and depleting, which is the most common method of coding because they are one complex than this one. So, this one is used in one -hutting coding. It's used more than a coding. It means that one is called linear and coding is in one -hutting. We're going to discuss about that one later. What is the name? Question? Okay. And this one is easy, right? Well, what it shows that sometimes we don't throw the, our targets. So, it means that it's not linear. These are linear. So, we're going to take a lot of data. Let's say, we want to predict the value of this. So, we use this guy as a training to predict this guy. Okay? Okay. I think we're now with the other. We can predict the value. Ready? And we can predict the value. Okay? I think </a></p>
