    <p><a name="ts_160710_168170_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:02:40.710]</span> UNKNOWN: regression, which is available in scikit-learn, linear models, OK. And also we have something</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_168170_177050_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:02:48.169]</span> UNKNOWN: for train test . Like whatever data set you have, to train And test.</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_177050_187560_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:02:57.050]</span> UNKNOWN: They do 80% for train, 20% for test. You train data and then test on test data.</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_187560_203480_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:03:07.560]</span> UNKNOWN: the model on there and test it. Okay. So, this Pyplot from Mathplot library is for just</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_203480_214730_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:03:23.479]</span> UNKNOWN: plotting, and NumPy is a library for working on tags. Okay? So, the other thing here is</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_214730_221920_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:03:34.729]</span> UNKNOWN: that, like, forget about this queue, I'm going to get back to this one. So, first thing here</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_221920_231560_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:03:41.919]</span> UNKNOWN: is that I want to create a synthetic data set, which has the 1000 data points, okay?</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_231560_242550_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:03:51.560]</span> UNKNOWN: And the formula or equation is something like this, 4, or in section, right? So, 3, and</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_242550_256620_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:04:02.550]</span> UNKNOWN: plus numbers. Okay? So, x is random points, 1000 random points, and I multiply that by</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_256620_257620_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:04:16.620]</span> UNKNOWN: 3.</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_257620_263290_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:04:17.620]</span> UNKNOWN: Okay? So, I'm going to get the values, and then y is coming from this. I added some noises</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_263290_270290_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:04:23.290]</span> UNKNOWN: because I want to see some noises in my data. And then if I create a function, I see that,</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_270290_279520_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:04:30.290]</span> UNKNOWN: okay, does my model learn those noises or not? Okay? And then here, just plotting, just</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_279520_287640_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:04:39.519]</span> UNKNOWN: plotting tags using the tlt.scatter, that means that I'm going to have something like this.</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_287640_289190_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:04:47.639]</span> UNKNOWN: Okay?</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_289190_293190_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:04:49.189]</span> UNKNOWN: And I'm going to get a little bit smaller. So, what you see here, the x is something</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_293190_299570_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:04:53.189]</span> UNKNOWN: with the, because, you see this rand? The output for rand is going to be between 0 and</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_299570_304570_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:04:59.569]</span> UNKNOWN: 1, as always, right? Rand, rand, rand of 1. If you want to convert that one to something</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_304570_314400_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:05:04.569]</span> UNKNOWN: between 0 to 2, you need to multiply that one by 2. Okay? If you multiply by 5, it's</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_314400_320010_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:05:14.399]</span> UNKNOWN: going to be between 0 and 1. So, that's why you see here, x is between 0 and 2. And then</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_320010_325690_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:05:20.009]</span> UNKNOWN: between 0 and 2, and your y is coming from this equation.</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_327280_332220_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:05:27.279]</span> UNKNOWN: Okay, again, noise is, you see that 4 plus 3x plus our noise,</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_332900_335420_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:05:32.899]</span> UNKNOWN: which is a small number, right?</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_338000_342820_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:05:38.000]</span> UNKNOWN: Okay, so what I see here is that 3 plus 4x.</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_344590_350880_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:05:44.589]</span> UNKNOWN: Maybe I can reduce this to, for example, 500.</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_350880_368340_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:05:50.879]</span> UNKNOWN: If I do that, 500, 500, and something like this.</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_369990_373730_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:06:09.990]</span> UNKNOWN: Okay, so I see that the relationship is kind of, like, linear.</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_377070_397980_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:06:17.069]</span> UNKNOWN: I believe here I can make, let me just show this in a color.</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_397980_416290_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:06:37.980]</span> UNKNOWN: Okay, marker, let me see if I can get a marker here, marker.</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_416370_425700_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:06:56.370]</span> UNKNOWN: Marker equal, yeah, okay, much, much better.</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_426240_431600_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:07:06.240]</span> UNKNOWN: Okay, so, and even we can decrease the size of this.</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_431860_441550_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:07:11.860]</span> UNKNOWN: Okay, so I have 1,000 data points, 1,000 data points here.</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_443380_448340_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:07:23.379]</span> UNKNOWN: Okay, and I see that this should be something like the relationship, like, linear.</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_449340_454690_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:07:29.339]</span> UNKNOWN: But there are a couple of points here, which is half light.</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_455780_460160_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:07:35.779]</span> UNKNOWN: Okay, so can I add the random seed?</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_460900_467020_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:07:40.899]</span> UNKNOWN: The responsibility of random seed is that if I deactivate this star, each time,</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_467020_471840_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:07:47.019]</span> UNKNOWN: these random points which are generated is going to be coming from different distributions.</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_472730_481050_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:07:52.730]</span> UNKNOWN: Maybe I run this one, and next time if I run the same thing, the same code,</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_484420_485600_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:08:04.420]</span> UNKNOWN: the data point can change.</a></p>

    <p><a name="ts_489230_495450_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:08:09.230]</span> UNKNOWN: This means that each time I have the same data, like, I write the code at home,</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_495450_499810_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:08:15.449]</span> UNKNOWN: then I want to show, I want to have the same data point.</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_500270_506040_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:08:20.269]</span> UNKNOWN: So, that's why I need to determine my data seed, okay?</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_506040_514940_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:08:26.040]</span> UNKNOWN: So, let me say seed 42 or whatever, seed 10, next time that I'm running the code,</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_515200_518980_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:08:35.200]</span> UNKNOWN: this data point, random data point will be the same, okay?</a></p>

    <p><a name="ts_527810_535680_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:08:47.809]</span> UNKNOWN: So, that's why it's necessary to have this one, especially when you want to show an experiment.</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_536380_539300_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:08:56.379]</span> UNKNOWN: Okay, so this is something that I have in my data.</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_539980_559500_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:08:59.980]</span> UNKNOWN: So, if I print data right now, so data, data, if I print data, okay, so I have X,</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_561420_571530_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:09:21.419]</span> UNKNOWN: so if I print X, so you see that X is an array, right, an array of 1,000 data points,</a></p>
