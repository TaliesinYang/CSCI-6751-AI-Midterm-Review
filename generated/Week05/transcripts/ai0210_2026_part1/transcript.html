    <p><a name="ts_6720_13660_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:00:06.719]</span> UNKNOWN: got it so validation is different from test data it's a part of our train data</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_14580_24220_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:00:14.580]</span> UNKNOWN: but it's used to evaluate the training okay the train model itself makes sense</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_26210_32369_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:00:26.210]</span> UNKNOWN: okay so that's why you see that sometimes uh you see validation and tests maybe sometimes</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_32369_42540_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:00:32.369]</span> UNKNOWN: you just see three and this okay uh it depends okay so now let's focus on the uh regression</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_42540_52380_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:00:42.539]</span> UNKNOWN: model there are a couple of uh metrics here which is uh used to evaluate the performance of the</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_52380_63150_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:00:52.380]</span> UNKNOWN: regression model so the first thing is mae mean absolute error means that y minus y hat divided by</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_64260_71300_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:01:04.260]</span> UNKNOWN: okay find the absolute error the difference between the target and prediction of the model</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_71300_80020_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:01:11.299]</span> UNKNOWN: the absolute value and then sum up this for all the observations for all the records and at the end</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_82420_91460_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:01:22.420]</span> UNKNOWN: okay it's called the mean absolute error it is very common okay so the other thing is</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_92020_96670_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:01:32.019]</span> UNKNOWN: is called mean squared error rather than y minus y hat</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_98380_105550_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:01:38.379]</span> UNKNOWN: you find a y minus y hat squared okay for each data item so for example</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_106590_119600_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:01:46.590]</span> UNKNOWN: data item one is going to be y 1 minus y hat 1 squared plus y 2 minus y hat 2 squared plus</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_120400_129539_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:02:00.400]</span> UNKNOWN: a right and then divided by the number of observations okay so it's called root e squared</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_130660_136290_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:02:10.659]</span> UNKNOWN: and then and then you can take the square root of that okay because that's in the</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_139680_149300_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:02:19.680]</span> UNKNOWN: degree of two then you can take again uh you can take the square root okay and we have also r</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_149300_156180_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:02:29.300]</span> UNKNOWN: squared we have adjusted r squared so you want to focus on uh each of this and explain so the</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_156180_160500_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:02:36.180]</span> UNKNOWN: most common one is the mae and rmse this is the</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_160980_168900_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:02:40.979]</span> UNKNOWN: uh equation that we have right so as i i made this is the simplest uh version of the you know</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_168900_179170_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:02:48.900]</span> UNKNOWN: those uh metrics so y minus y hat for all the data items and then divided by the number of so y</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_179170_189150_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:02:59.169]</span> UNKNOWN: here is the front row y hat is the model prediction okay so the difference between these</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_189150_193200_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:03:09.150]</span> UNKNOWN: two which is the absolute value right positive okay so this is the absolute value right positive</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_194080_201680_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:03:14.080]</span> UNKNOWN: example two minus y is absolute value is going to be plus two right so that's why you see absolute</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_203220_220720_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:03:23.219]</span> UNKNOWN: and it's called absolute there okay any question on this it is very common for example suppose</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_220720_230780_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:03:40.719]</span> UNKNOWN: that here um we want to make a model which uh tells that what what could be the failure uh</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_231580_233820_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:03:51.580]</span> UNKNOWN: maybe the failure is something between zero to one</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_233900_242990_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:03:53.900]</span> UNKNOWN: hundred based on the age okay let's say you have a machine and you want to know that what is the</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_242990_249310_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:04:02.990]</span> UNKNOWN: percentage of failure for that machine for different machines we have the age of that machine</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_249310_256029_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:04:09.310]</span> UNKNOWN: the higher the age the chance of failure is all right that's why you see here it's almost kind of</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_256029_265220_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:04:16.029]</span> UNKNOWN: like a linear relationship okay so suppose that we uh see the model using for example</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_265940_274100_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:04:25.939]</span> UNKNOWN: linear regression okay now we have the predictions okay so prediction is the green part</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_275860_286300_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:04:35.860]</span> UNKNOWN: h10 this is the failure and the green one is the model prediction age 20 for example here failure</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_286300_294260_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:04:46.300]</span> UNKNOWN: is 30 which is this and the green part is the prediction so the only thing we need to know</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_295220_298260_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:04:55.220]</span> UNKNOWN: just we need to find the error between predictions</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_298420_305050_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:04:58.420]</span> UNKNOWN: Prediction and failure, which is 11, right?</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_305670_307730_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:05:05.670]</span> UNKNOWN: And this one is two, right?</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_307730_312860_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:05:07.730]</span> UNKNOWN: These differences, and maybe here is negative five,</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_313020_317960_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:05:13.019]</span> UNKNOWN: because prediction is missing from truth.</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_317960_321890_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:05:17.959]</span> UNKNOWN: And after that one, we find the absolute value</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_321890_328320_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:05:21.889]</span> UNKNOWN: of this error, and then take that, which is eight point.</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_328320_333320_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:05:28.319]</span> UNKNOWN: So mean absolute error of this model is eight point five.</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_336630_340750_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:05:36.629]</span> UNKNOWN: Maybe you can ask, eight point five is good?</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_340750_342870_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:05:40.750]</span> UNKNOWN: Why it's not close to zero?</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_342870_345680_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:05:42.870]</span> UNKNOWN: It depends on the context, okay?</a></p>

    <p><a name="ts_348920_353000_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:05:48.920]</span> UNKNOWN: eight is good, but in some systems,</a></p>

    <p><a name="ts_355700_360180_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:05:55.699]</span> UNKNOWN: So that depends on the use case you are using.</a></p>
    <p><a name="ts_360180_362740_UNKNOWN"><span style="color:#78909C">[00:06:00.180]</span> UNKNOWN: But the lower, we know that the lower failure,</a></p>
